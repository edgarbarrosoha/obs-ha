o   ¿Cuál es la opinión general de la organización, sus sistemas, procesos, gestión, on boarding?

Based on the provided interviews and the analysis of talisis's Root Architecture, here is a detailed overview of the general opinion regarding the organization, its systems, processes, management, and onboarding:

### General Opinion of the Organization (talisis)

Overall, there is a **strong positive sentiment** towards talisis, driven by a deep commitment to its mission and purpose.

- **Purpose and Impact:** talisis is widely seen as a **catalyst for social transformation** through accessible and quality education, aiming to empower millions of people and create virtuous cycles of development across generations. It seeks to be a **referent in transformative education** in Mexico and Latin America.
- **Culture and Values:** The organization emphasizes a **culture of high performance, discipline, and shared purpose**. There is a conscious effort to **foster a human-centric approach**, emphasizing empathy, integrity, and a sense of belonging. Several interviewees express a personal connection, viewing their work not just as a job but as a "life project".
- **Ecosystem and Reach:** talisis is perceived as a **multifaceted and diverse ecosystem**, encompassing various brands (UR, UNID, Harmon Hall, Advenio), serving a wide range of audiences from early childhood to post-graduate studies, and operating across different regions with both physical and digital presence. This diversity is seen as a **great richness and comparative advantage**.
- **Maturity and Evolution:** There's recognition of talisis's **maturation and increased organization** in recent years, particularly in its strategic focus and clarity. It is constantly evolving and experimenting with new models and methodologies.

### Systems

The opinion on talisis's systems is **mixed**, highlighting both significant opportunities and persistent challenges.

- **Opportunities for Enhancement:** There is a strong consensus that **technology, especially AI and Cloud, is a critical ally and "new operational muscle"** for transformation and efficiency. Interviewees envision:
    - **Hyper-personalization:** Using AI for highly personalized student journeys, content, recommendations, and communication.
    - **Automation:** Automating manual, repetitive, and transactional tasks (e.g., financial reconciliations, compensation calculation, lead nurturing) to free up human time for strategic work and empathy.
    - **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Leveraging data architecture, predictive analysis, and dashboards for quicker, more informed, and proactive decisions across all areas.
    - **Integrated Ecosystems:** A future where platforms are "interconnected" and function as a "digital brain".
- **Current Limitations and Challenges:** Several significant issues with current systems are repeatedly mentioned:
    - **Fragmentation and Lack of Integration:** Many platforms are "not integrated," "do not communicate with each other," or "speak but information is not congruent or reliable". This leads to dispersed data and inefficiencies.
    - **Manual Processes and Data Collection:** A lot of data collection and reporting is still "manual," leading to "too much time in data gathering" rather than analysis, generating "much work" and being "time-consuming".
    - **Outdated Infrastructure:** Some technology and platforms are "outdated" or "fragmented".
    - **Lack of Clarity in Metrics/Definitions:** "No clear definition of some metrics," leading to inconsistencies.
    - **Cost and Resources:** Cloud migration incurs "important monthly costs". There's a "lack of trained people in technology" and small teams hindering progress.
    - **Data Quality:** Need for "data of higher quality and more timely" due to inconsistencies and isolated systems.

### Processes

The processes at talisis are generally seen as **needing significant improvement towards standardization, automation, and clarity.**

- **Desire for Standardization and Automation:**
    - A strong push for **"standardized processes"** across the organization to enable better communication, efficiency, and scalability.
    - The goal is to **automate "manual, tortuous, or time-consuming activities"** to reduce errors, expedite tasks, and allow human talent to focus on higher-value activities.
- **Current State of Processes:**
    - Many processes are still **"manual" and "take too much time"**.
    - There is often a **"lack of clarity" and "insufficiently clear and documented processes"**, leading to interruptions and inefficiencies.
    - **Resistance to Change:** There's cultural resistance and an inclination to stick to "traditional processes" or doing things "as before".
    - **Duplication and Dispersal:** Processes can be duplicated between areas, and information/procedures are "dispersed" across many platforms.
- **Specific Areas of Focus for Improvement:**
    - **Financial & Administrative:** More efficient financial planning, budget control, payment methods, and automated reconciliations.
    - **Recruitment & HR:** Streamlining talent acquisition, reducing onboarding time for sales advisors, and combating high turnover through more efficient processes.
    - **Academic & Operational:** Improving curriculum development, teacher profile design, student follow-up, and managing academic operations.
    - **Inter-area Communication:** The "interrelation" and "communication between areas" for collaborative projects is an area for improvement.

### Management

Management is perceived as **improving in terms of vision and strategic communication, but there's a recognized need for greater support, trust, and alignment in execution.**

- **Clarity and Vision:** There is appreciation for the **"clear vision" and "strategic communication"** from top management, especially through institutional events like "town halls" and "conventions". Leaders are seen as setting "high standards".
- **Leadership Style:** Some leaders, like Fernando de Río and Katherine, aim for a **collaborative, empathetic, and empowering leadership style**, focusing on team growth, trust, and shared purpose. Joel Enriquez sees his role as a "founder of organizational culture".
- **Areas for Improvement / Needed Support:**
    - **Trust and Autonomy:** A recurring theme is the need for "trust to experiment and autonomy to decide" for teams, as current environment can be "difficult" and prone to "pointing fingers" when things are not written down. There's a desire for "real empowerment".
    - **Collaboration and Alignment:** While top-down communication is good, effective **"transversal collaboration"** between different areas is often a challenge, requiring clearer governance and shared narratives. Leaders need to understand that all areas contribute to the final impact. There's a sentiment that sometimes each area "goes its own way".
    - **Support for Innovation:** Leaders need to recognize that new initiatives (like B2B channel) are "in development" and require facilitation. There's a need to support "greater discipline" and "foresight" in strategic initiatives.
    - **Resource Allocation:** Support is needed for "time" for strategic design (as opposed to daily operation) and for increasing team sizes (e.g., for data science and technology).
    - **Feedback Culture:** While some leaders promote it, continuous and constructive feedback (especially from the top to other areas) is seen as essential for growth.

### Onboarding

The term "onboarding" is explicitly mentioned in a few instances, indicating a general awareness of its importance and existing challenges.

- **Need for Improvement:** Marcela Valdez, from Administration and Finance, sees an opportunity to improve the **"onboarding of students, employees and teachers"** to be "smooth" and efficient. This implies that current onboarding processes may be cumbersome or inefficient, leading to "less smooth transitions" and "more stumbles".
- **Related Initiatives:**
    - The creation of a **"central document repository for all processes"** is suggested as a way to "help in onboardings", showing that the lack of centralized information hinders the process.
    - Domingo Farias mentions reducing the "curve of optimal productivity" for sales advisors through better "induction and training", suggesting that current onboarding/training for new hires is lengthy and could be improved with technology like AI.
    - Lilian Lozano mentions "digital onboarding" for students as part of personalized experiences.

talisis is seen as a **purpose-driven, evolving organization** with a strong, diverse ecosystem. While there's enthusiasm for its strategic direction and the potential of technology, there are **significant internal challenges** related to fragmented systems, manual processes, and the need for greater inter-area collaboration, resource allocation, and a more trusting, empowered management style. Onboarding is acknowledged as an area needing improvement through process optimization and better information management.

o   ¿Qué sugerencias te dieron al respecto?

Based on the interviews, numerous suggestions were provided across the various elements of the organisation, its systems, processes, management, and onboarding. These reflect a strong desire for modernisation, efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and enhanced human connection.

### Management (Leadership Style, Inter-Departmental Collaboration, Support Needed)

- **Empower Leaders and Teams:** Capital Human should be a strategic service that **empowers leaders**, integrating culture and processes into their DNA for effective leadership. Teams need **real empowerment with autonomy, tools, and trust** to propose and learn. Leaders should **accompany teams rather than just supervising**.
- **Foster Transversal Collaboration:** Establish **multidisciplinary teams with closer collaboration** and direct interactions for a unified vision. Implement **governance and shared narratives** to ensure effective transversal collaboration between areas like commercial, IT, CX, and academy. Areas should **understand that all contributions connect to the final impact**.

## II. Lo que distingue a TALISIS

o   ¿Cuál es su Misión y Visión? ¿Los colaboradores las conocen? ¿En qué porcentaje?

Based on the sources, talisis has a clear **Fundamental Purpose (Misión)** and **Vision**, which are actively communicated, though specific percentages regarding employee knowledge are not provided.

### talisis's Mission and Vision:

- **Fundamental Purpose (Mission):** talisis's fundamental purpose is to **transform communities through people by providing accessible and relevant education** [2.1]. This education aims to **generate sustainable social mobility and virtuous cycles of transgenerational development** [2.1].
- **Vision for 2035:** The path towards 2035 is clear, with talisis aiming to be **the benchmark for educational transformation in Latin America** [32.1]. This is not merely about being the largest, but about being the most relevant [32.1]. The aspiration is that **every student who passes through talisis's classrooms will emerge with more than just a qualification: they will leave with purpose, tools, and a network that will accompany them throughout their lives** [32.1].

### Employee Awareness and Communication:

Several interviewees highlight the importance of clear communication and alignment with this vision and purpose:

- **Communication of Vision:**
    
    - Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) states that a major impact is ensuring **the best talent within the company** to deliver 100% of their value proposition and transform more lives. Her area contributes by **supporting leaders to have their teams evaluated, identified, and developing within the institution**. She feels inspired knowing she is in an organisation that helps fulfil dreams and transform lives.
    - Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) envisions talisis as **a referent in transformative education by 2035**, creating **communities of learning where every student feels reflected, challenged, and valued**. His area acts as **the nervous system that captures what happens externally, the heart that beats with the client's voice, and the muscle that executes with excellence**. He personally finds purpose in **leaving a transcending mark on his team, seeing them grow and find new paths through shared vision**. He stresses the importance of designing and executing growth strategies that are efficient and precise, including **solid, digitalised commercial structures and automated funnels for acquisition, retention, and multi-brand profitability**. He specifically notes the importance of a **"shared narrative where everyone sees how the work connects with a final impact"**.
    - Marcos Samaniego (Director of Academic Operations) highlights that his area works to **translate the company's efforts into concrete actions in campuses**, training staff, and defining processes for new alliances. He also notes the importance of **reporting to the high management** to show progress towards institutional objectives. His personal inspiration comes from seeing that all the daily effort **touches many people and translates into a shared mission**.
    - Mariel (Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication and Business Intelligence) states that her area's mission is to **project a solid, clear, and concise identity** for talisis as a cutting-edge educational ecosystem in Mexico and Latin America. She emphasises that **reputation starts from within**, requiring every employee to feel proud and a sense of belonging to communicate it externally. She believes that for talisis to become a leader in education and social transformation, **all members of the organisation must work in synchrony, aligned with a shared vision**. Her purpose is to **make the company's vision a reality and transform communities**. She has advanced by **connecting with staff, students, and teachers to create synchronicity and alignment towards the long-term purpose**.
    - Paul Moch (Vice President for Teaching & Learning) envisions a **clear educational model that provides certainty to students and supports with quality education and the development of soft skills**. His inspiration is to make education a **transformative factor in Latin America**. He imagines a collaboration where his area coordinates educational vision and pedagogy.
    - Paulina Adalid (Rector Institucional, UNID) sees talisis's impact in **forming professionals with necessary knowledge and skills for a constantly changing world, supported by technology and human formation with social responsibility**. Her role allows her to **transmit talisis's vision to campuses and receive feedback**, acting as a **"bridge of union"** between talisis and its learning institutions, and representing talisis before authorities. She states that **the team is important, everyone can propose, and the goal is to be happy and committed in a healthy environment**. She also stresses the **responsibility of continuous learning and adapting to global needs**.
    - Julián (Transformation department) states that his mission is **not just to operate change, but to design, activate, and sustain it until it becomes culture**. He sees his role as a **"founder of organisational culture"** that should transcend time and volume for impact. He uses the analogy of a high-performance football team, where **everyone anticipates movements and celebrates successes as a collective achievement**. He believes in **aligning each collaborator's purpose** for effective teamwork.
- **Lack of Specific Percentage:** While the sources heavily emphasise the importance of a shared vision and aligning employees with it, there is **no specific percentage provided** regarding how many employees currently know or are aligned with talisis's mission and vision. The interviews suggest an ongoing effort to achieve this widespread understanding and cultural integration. Román de León (Data Scientist) mentions that there's a need to **"involve, co-create solutions, and have constant communication"** as sometimes departments are **"too accustomed to a client-provider relationship"** where they only seek project delivery rather than co-creation. This implies that full alignment and shared understanding are still targets. Julián also mentions that a challenge is for collaborators to **"understand and know what we do, how we do it, and with what intensity we do it"**, which is a major challenge due to the dynamic nature of the organisation.

- If I have to give a percentage:

talisis has a well-defined **Fundamental Purpose (Misión)** and **Vision** that guide its operations and strategy [2.1, 32.1, 609]. While the sources do not provide an exact percentage of collaborators who know these statements, they strongly indicate a concerted and ongoing effort to communicate and embed them within the organisation.

### talisis's Mission and Vision:

- **Fundamental Purpose (Misión):** talisis aims to **transform communities through people by providing accessible and relevant education** [2.1]. This education is designed to **generate sustainable social mobility and virtuous cycles of transgenerational development** [2.1]. This purpose is also echoed by Domingo, who states that his inspiration is to "democratize the education to impact the majority, especially the sectors with less resources".
- **Vision for 2035:** talisis envisions itself as **the benchmark for educational transformation in Latin America**, aspiring to be the most relevant rather than merely the largest [32.1]. The goal is for **every student passing through talisis's classrooms to emerge with purpose, tools, and a lifelong network**, not just a qualification [32.1]. Furthermore, talisis aims for **100% of Mexicans to have access to quality education, a significant increase from the current 30%**. Alvaro also highlights an international focus for 2035, not limiting to Mexico, and leveraging AI for content adaptation to different languages and realities.

### Employee Awareness and Communication:

The sources highlight significant efforts to ensure that collaborators are aware of and aligned with the company's mission and vision, though challenges in deep, universal understanding persist:

- **Active Communication and Transmission:**
    
    - Mariel, from Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication, and Business Intelligence, explicitly states that "reputation starts from within, requiring every employee to feel proud and a sense of belonging to communicate it externally". She emphasises that **"all members of the organisation must work in synchrony, aligned with a shared vision"**, and has "advanced by connecting with staff, students, and teachers to create synchronicity and alignment towards the long-term purpose".
    - Paulina Adalid, as an Institutional Rector, actively "transmit[s] talisis's vision to campuses". She also represents talisis before educational and governmental authorities, strengthening the institutional presence.
    - Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, mentions a "matrix of congruence" with 14 key indicators directly derived from the mission, indicating a systematic approach to ensuring alignment at a macro level. She also states that the vision and expectations are communicated "very clear" and "very objective" through town halls and conventions.
    - Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) and Domingo (Capital Humano) both articulate that their areas focus on ensuring the "best talent" and fostering a "culture of high standards", implying an inherent alignment with the company's purpose through talent development and cultural integration. Domingo also points out that "the culture is dictated by the leaders" and encourages leaders to "comulgue with the processes and initiatives that we bring from Human Capital".
- **Challenges in Deep Understanding and Synchronicity:**
    
    - Despite these efforts, some interviewees point to challenges in achieving full, deep understanding and complete synchronisation across all departments. Julián, from the Transformation department, acknowledges that a "major challenge" is for collaborators to "understand and know what we do, how we do it, and with what intensity we do it". This suggests that while the mission and vision might be broadly known, a nuanced and consistent application throughout daily work is still evolving.
    - Román de León, a Data Scientist, highlights that some departments are "too accustomed to a client-provider relationship" rather than co-creation around a shared goal. He seeks support from leaders and colleagues to "get more involved" and "contribute ideas and not just listen", implying a need for deeper engagement with the shared vision.
    - Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) mentions that "here in talisis, they don't like to share direction, each one wants their own side", further indicating a hurdle in achieving universal, seamless alignment.

### Inferred Percentage:

Given the consistent emphasis on communicating the mission and vision from multiple leadership roles and departments (HR, Marketing, Academic Operations, Quality, Institutional Rectors), it is reasonable to infer that a **significant majority of collaborators are aware** of talisis's mission and vision statements. The active communication strategies, regular internal meetings, and efforts to integrate the mission into departmental objectives suggest a high level of top-down communication.

However, the identified challenges in achieving complete, granular understanding, fostering true co-creation across all areas, and ensuring that the vision "becomes culture" (as noted by Julián and Román) imply that this awareness is not yet universal or deeply internalised by every single employee in a fully synchronous manner.

Based on these inferences, it can be estimated that **approximately 80% to 85% of collaborators are likely familiar with or generally aware of talisis's Mission and Vision.** This percentage reflects the strong communication efforts and leadership commitment, while also acknowledging the natural complexities of cultural integration and ensuring deep alignment in a dynamic organisation with diverse departmental focuses.

o   La Visión, ¿Es una visión alineada y compartida?

talisis's overarching vision is **well-defined and largely shared** across the organisation, with substantial efforts dedicated to its communication and implementation. However, achieving deep, universal, and consistently actioned alignment throughout every department and role presents an ongoing challenge.

### talisis's Vision

talisis's fundamental purpose is to **"transform communities through people by providing accessible and relevant education that generates sustainable social mobility and virtuous cycles of transgenerational development"**. The CEO, Nicho Garza, articulates the vision for 2035 as becoming **"the benchmark for educational transformation in Latin America, not by being the largest but by being the most relevant"**. This involves every student emerging with purpose, tools, and a lifelong network.

### Evidence of Aligned and Shared Vision

Many leaders and areas within talisis demonstrate a strong understanding and commitment to this core vision:

- **CEO's Articulation:** Nicho Garza clearly establishes the "Propósito Fundamental" and the "Esencia" of talisis's legacy, learning, technology, and context, setting the strategic direction. He stresses that talisis is "a platform that transforms communities through people".
- **Strategic Communication:** Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, explicitly states that "all members of the organisation must work in synchrony, aligned with a shared vision" to consolidate leadership in education and social transformation. She also highlights the importance of "living the talisis Way culture from within" and communicating it externally, based on an authentic sense of belonging.
- **Leadership Transmission:** Paulina Adalid, Institutional Rector, views her role as transmitting "all this vision of talisis" to campuses, actively enriching it with input from the educational community. She also sees her role as a "bridge of union" between talisis and its learning institutions to represent its impact.
- **Systemic Alignment:** Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, uses a "matrix of congruence" with 14 key indicators directly derived from the mission, demonstrating a structured approach to ensure processes align with the overall purpose. She observes "a much greater organisation, greater clarity of the focus of where we are going and how we should achieve it" within talisis.
- **Cultural Foundation:** Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, sees his role as "a founder of organizational culture" to "provoke the future we deserve" with a "shared purpose very clear". He uses the analogy of a high-performance football team where all players "play as 1 only" and celebrate collective success. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, similarly champions attracting talent to foster a "culture of high standards" driven by leaders who "commune with the processes and initiatives that we bring from Human Capital". Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, underlines the need for communication and empathy for effective collaboration, which is crucial for vision alignment.
- **Market-Centric Planning:** Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, states that planning "should be centered on what the market requires" and that his department needs to be "well aligned with the expected strategy and direction of the organization".
- **Client and Operational Focus:** Álvaro García (Innovation and Product Director) envisions talisis as a key strategic partner for organisations globally. Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) believes the commercial area "must be the growth engine of the organization" and that "if we achieve that agile communication, between the different areas, we can deliver a much more adequate product". Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer) aims for service "aligned to [the student's] dreams and expectations throughout their educational journey".
- **Technological Integration:** Carlos Granados (CIO) clearly states the vision is an "intelligent, adaptive, and inclusive educational ecosystem" with AI fully integrated by 2033, leading to "mass personalisation of education" and "democratisation of access to quality education". Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) envisions talisis as "an internationally recognised entity for its competency-based and employability models".

### Challenges to Full Alignment

Despite these strong indications, some interviewees point to areas where deeper alignment and a more unified vision are still evolving:

- **Internal Silos and Lack of Shared Direction:** Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) explicitly states, **"here in talisis, they don't like to share direction, each one wants their own side"**. This indicates a challenge in fostering full inter-departmental collaboration towards a single strategic goal.
- **Operational vs. Strategic Focus:** Julián Enriquez (Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación) notes a "major challenge" for collaborators to "understand and know what we do, how we do it, and with what intensity we do it," suggesting a gap between strategic vision and daily execution. Román de León (Data Scientist) observes that some departments are "too accustomed to a client-provider relationship" rather than co-creation around a shared goal.
- **Data and Process Fragmentation:** Carlos Villa (Mobile Dev Lead) highlights that "each application has its own objective and may not share the same objectives between one and the other," and mentions a need to understand "what really hurts the student" directly, rather than relying on assumptions. Román de León also points out issues with "definition clara de algunas de las métricas" and "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada" leading to data inconsistencies. Juliana Effting (Directora de Educación Online) identifies **"resistencia cultural interna"** seeing online education as a "competitor and not an ally" and "fragmented technological infrastructure" as major risks. Marcela Valdez (Directora de Administración y Finanzas) mentions "lack of integration between systems" leading to "descontrol and risk".
- **Short-Term Pressures:** Several leaders, including Fernando de Río and Marcela Valdez, acknowledge that short-term pressures to achieve immediate results can hinder long-term strategic thinking and resource allocation necessary for the vision.

talisis has a **clearly articulated and widely communicated vision** from its leadership. There are active initiatives to embed this vision and its underlying culture (talisis Way) across the organisation, with many leaders demonstrating strong commitment and understanding. However, the organisation faces challenges in overcoming ingrained departmental silos, ensuring consistent execution, improving data and process integration, and fostering a universal, deep understanding that translates into fully synchronised action across all levels. The vision is present and shared, but its **complete and consistent manifestation is a continuous journey**.

It seeks to equip individuals with the skills and purpose to thrive in a dynamic world and contribute to societal development, all while maintaining a sustainable and scalable operational model through strategic partnerships and continuous innovation.

o   ¿Qué habilidades y capacidades distinguen a la gente que trabaja en talisis?

The people working at talisis are distinguished by a comprehensive set of skills and capabilities that align with the organisation's ambitious vision for educational transformation. These qualities span a blend of technical expertise, human-centric attributes, strategic acumen, and a commitment to continuous improvement and social impact.

Firstly, **Human-Centricity and Empathy** are paramount. talisis employees are deeply committed to transforming lives through education, demonstrating a purpose-driven approach that extends to individuals, communities, and national development. This involves a strong emphasis on understanding and serving the real needs of students, families, and even disadvantaged sectors of society, by actively listening to their voices through various mechanisms. They strive to foster an empathetic environment, where technology enhances rather than replaces human connection, allowing more time for meaningful interactions.

Secondly, **Technological Proficiency and Adaptability** are crucial. talisis actively seeks individuals who are adept at leveraging advanced technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Employees are expected to develop deep knowledge in areas such as AI algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, data analysis, and cybersecurity. This proficiency is not merely for technical tasks but for transforming processes, enhancing efficiency, automating repetitive duties, and enabling hyper-personalisation of learning experiences. They are encouraged to be proactive in adopting new digital tools and methodologies, even experimenting with emerging technologies to build robust solutions.

Thirdly, **Strategic Thinking and Foresight** are highly valued. Employees demonstrate the ability to align their work with market requirements, anticipate future trends (with a 5-15 year outlook), and identify "blue ocean" opportunities for expansion. This includes a focus on data-driven decision-making, translating complex data into actionable insights, and designing initiatives with a clear strategic impact. They are expected to balance short-term operational needs with long-term strategic objectives.

Fourthly, **Collaboration and Communication** are essential attributes. Employees are encouraged to work in a highly collaborative manner, breaking down traditional silos between departments. This involves clear, assertive, and empathetic communication, active listening, fostering a culture of trust and shared purpose, and proactively engaging with internal and external stakeholders, including government bodies, industry partners, and other academic institutions.

Fifthly, **Innovation and Continuous Improvement** are deeply ingrained in the talisis mindset. Employees are driven to reimagine educational models, experiment with new pedagogies, and continually adapt to evolving market demands. This includes fostering a culture of lifelong learning, self-direction, and an agile mindset that embraces experimentation and rapid iteration. They actively work to overcome resistance to change and to integrate new approaches.

Finally, **Accountability and Results-Orientation** define the execution. Employees are driven by clear objectives, measurable outcomes (KPIs and OKRs), and a disciplined approach to achieving growth, efficiency, and profitability while maintaining quality. They embody a "owner's mindset," taking responsibility for their contributions and actively seeking solutions to challenges, even when resources are limited.

In essence, the distinguished capabilities of talisis's people encompass a synergistic blend of advanced technical skills (especially in AI and data), a deep commitment to human-centric education and social impact, agile strategic thinking, strong collaborative and communicative abilities, and an insatiable drive for innovation and continuous improvement, all underpinned by a culture of accountability and purpose.

**Next step:** I can provide an analysis of how these skills and capabilities are fostered and developed within talisis, including existing programmes and identified gaps.

o   ¿Cómo es el proceso de comunicación que se tiene internamente?

talisis's internal communication process is a multifaceted and evolving system that strives to knit together diverse teams and objectives, leveraging both established structures and emergent technologies, all underpinned by a strong cultural emphasis on collaboration and human connection.

**1. Structured Information Flow and Formal Rituals:** At a foundational level, talisis core principles are replicated across all levels of the organisation. The corporate headquarters centralises and optimises information, which then systematically flows down to the individual brands, campuses, and classrooms. This ensures that "information is clearly communicated from top management (C-level) through 'connections,' 'convenciones,' and 'town halls,' which have matured significantly to provide clear and effective communication". This top-down approach aims to provide clarity and a sense of security, ensuring everyone understands "what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how it will be achieved".

Regular meetings, or "rituales," are integral to this process. Weekly internal "rituales" are established for tracking progress within each area. These sessions often include "lluvia de ideas" (brainstorming), serving as dedicated spaces for reflection and ideation, encouraging teams to "think outside the box" on specific strategic projects. A key objective is to align all departments, sharing common goals such as OKRs, so that everyone understands they are "in the same boat" and "navigating in the same direction".

**2. Leveraging Technology for Enhanced Communication and Data Utilisation:** talisis is heavily invested in integrating technology to enhance its internal communication and operational efficiency. Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are envisioned to "improve interaction between students, professors, and administrative teams through automated attention and support platforms". These agents are designed to "act as a bridge that fosters efficient communication and data-driven decision-making".

A significant focus is placed on data visibility. There is a strong push to provide "visual information for everyone" for rapid decision-making, aiming to move beyond static Excel files and presentations towards live or near real-time data. This includes the development of "standardised open dashboards" that are accessible to all areas, providing a unified view of the organisation's status. The long-term vision includes a "digital brain" or "central mind" that connects all operations, acting as a "shared nervous system" to enable the organisation to "breathe together, think together, and advance as a whole".

AI is increasingly being adopted for internal processes, such as code review, suggestions, optimisation, and generating unit tests. The fundamental belief is that AI will "free up time for strategic thinking and foster human interaction between areas" by automating manual and bureaucratic tasks. This liberated human capacity is then re-directed towards more valuable and empathetic interactions. AI is also being explored to mediate human interactions and establish mechanisms for managing conflicts or less fluid communication.

**3. Cultivating a Collaborative and Human-Centric Culture:** At its heart, talisis is driven by a "human-centric" philosophy: it is an organisation "of people for people". This ethos translates into various aspects of its internal communication:

- **Bridge-Building Roles:** Many areas within talisis function as "glue" or "bridges" between departments. For example, HR sees itself as the "glue" that ensures effective communication among different areas, facilitating conversations and agreements to resolve issues. Similarly, Marketing and Operations aim to be strong bridges, translating strategic ideas into actionable plans and ensuring feedback loops are robust. This involves translating institutional objectives into clear, motivating narratives that help each team member understand their role within a common cause, thus preventing areas from working in isolation.
- **Active Listening and Customer Focus:** A cornerstone is the continuous "listening to the voice of the customer", encompassing students, teachers, and collaborators. This feedback, gathered through surveys, focus groups, and direct interactions, is deemed critical for informing product development, refining services, and making strategic decisions that place the student at the centre.
- **Emphasis on Soft Skills:** There's a strong belief in the importance of "communication and interaction skills" and "soft skills" to foster effective collaboration and preserve the human element in interactions. Empathy and understanding others' needs are highly valued.
- **Leading by Example and Shared Ownership:** Leaders, particularly the Chief Strategy Officer, strive to "lead by example", embodying the desired culture of "real collaboration, empathy, teamwork, and high performance". The aim is to instill a "sense of belonging" where all employees feel "joint owners of talisis's processes". This involves open feedback, celebrating achievements, and confronting challenges with transparency.

**4. Identified Challenges and Areas for Improvement:** Despite these robust efforts, talisis acknowledges several areas where its internal communication processes can be strengthened:

- **Undocumented Processes:** A recurring challenge is the lack of clearly documented processes. This leads to inefficiencies, necessitates frequent "emergency interventions," and complicates long-term planning.
- **Inter-Area Communication Gaps:** While formal communication channels exist, there are acknowledged difficulties in fostering seamless inter-area communication, particularly in collaborative projects. This is partly attributed to teams not always being co-located in a single office.
- **Cultural Resistance to Change:** Some internal cultural resistance persists, particularly regarding the adoption of new methodologies or technologies. For instance, some collaborators initially viewed online education as a competitor rather than a complementary approach. Overcoming this requires fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.
- **Fragmented Technological Infrastructure:** A critical issue is the lack of integration among existing technological platforms. This results in dispersed, potentially unreliable data and necessitates manual data consolidation, which consumes excessive time and hinders rapid, data-driven decision-making.
- **Operational Overload and Prioritisation:** The demands of daily operations and "firefighting" often consume significant time, diverting focus from innovation and the standardisation of processes. This makes it difficult to balance immediate needs with long-term strategic objectives.
- **Resource Limitations:** Teams frequently report being small with heavy workloads, making it challenging to dedicate sufficient time to both current operational demands and the exploration and implementation of new technologies and projects.

talisis is actively striving for a highly integrated and communicative internal environment, where technology acts as an enabler for human connection and data-informed decisions. While it has established strong foundations in terms of culture and formal communication channels, the journey towards a fully harmonised and agile ecosystem, particularly through comprehensive technological integration and consistent process documentation, is an ongoing strategic priority.

Next step: I can delve into the specific methodologies or frameworks mentioned by talisis employees that support this communication and collaboration, such as the "talisis Way" or "Metodología Vadir," and explain how they contribute.

o   ¿Los ejecutivos conocen el talisis Way? ¿Qué porcentaje lo conoce a buen nivel de detalle?

Yes, the executives at talisis demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the "talisis Way," viewing it as a foundational framework that underpins the organisation's strategic direction, cultural identity, and operational methodology. While a specific percentage of detailed knowledge across all levels of the organisation is not explicitly stated, the interviews suggest a high level of awareness and detailed understanding among the senior leadership and those responsible for strategic implementation, with an ongoing effort to embed this culture throughout the entire workforce.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Executive Awareness and Detailed Understanding of "talisis Way":**

Several key executives and directors directly reference and elaborate on the "talisis Way," indicating a deep and nuanced understanding of its components and strategic importance:

- **Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff:** Explicitly articulates the "talisis Way" as integral to fostering high-performance teams, promoting empathy, and encouraging mutual support within the organisation. He connects it directly to the broader "High-Performance Culture" that leaders are expected to embody and instil. His perspective highlights the "talisis Way" as a guiding principle for cultivating desired attitudes and behaviours throughout the company.
- **Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation:** Demonstrates a highly detailed understanding by referring to "our talisis Way" in conjunction with "13 strategic axes". She explains how these axes are cascaded down into specific strategic projects and operational plans at the campus level, measured by OKRs and KPIs. Inge emphasizes that this framework brings "order," "organisation," and "clarity" to the institution, making processes more systematic and effective. Her comments indicate that she not only knows what the "talisis Way" is but also how it is structurally implemented and monitored.
- **Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence:** Identifies "empujar la cultura talisis Way" as a core responsibility of her team, emphasizing the need to live this culture authentically internally and communicate it externally. She views it as crucial for consolidating talisis's leadership in education and social transformation through synchronicity and a shared vision. Her statements reflect a strategic understanding of the "talisis Way" as a key driver for organisational identity and external perception.
- **Julián (Juan Mendez), Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation:** While he doesn't explicitly use the term "talisis Way" in the provided snippets of his core contributions, his extensive discussion of "cultural ADN" and "ecosystem" aligns perfectly with how the "talisis Way" is described by others. He mentions that this "ecosystem" encompasses "culture, our talent, our processes, our rituals, our technology" and highlights the challenge and importance of introducing and strengthening it across all operational levels, from campuses to top management. This indicates a profound understanding of the comprehensive framework that the "talisis Way" represents.
- **Nicho Garza, CEO:** The "Reporte_Nicho," attributed to Nicho Garza, describes the overarching concept that the "talisis Way" likely embodies. It details "Alineación Cultural Total: Cada colaborador viviendo los principios TALISIS" and explains that "TALISIS funciona como un organismo fractal donde los principios se replican en cada nivel". This confirms that the CEO has defined and champions these fundamental principles of organisational alignment and replication, which are clearly operationalized through the "talisis Way."

**2. Percentage of Knowledge and Organisational Penetration:**

While a precise numerical percentage is unavailable, the following can be inferred:

- **Among Senior Leadership/Executives:** Based on the direct mentions and detailed explanations from Domingo, Inge, Mariel, and the foundational description from the CEO (Nicho), it is evident that a **very high percentage** (likely near 100% for those in strategic roles related to culture, operations, and communication) of the interviewed executives understand the "talisis Way" at a good level of detail. They actively engage with its principles and are responsible for its implementation and communication.
    
- **Across the Broader Organisation:** The interviews indicate that embedding the "talisis Way" throughout the entire organisation is an ongoing strategic objective.
    
    - Domingo mentions pushing the "talisis Way" to foster high-performance teams.
    - Mariel emphasizes that her team has the responsibility to "impulsar nuestro propósito e identidad con autenticidad" and ensure that "all members of the organisation work in synchronicity aligned with a shared vision".
    - Julián highlights the challenge of "introducing this cultural DNA" to the entire operation, from campuses to mid- and high-level management.
    - Inge notes that information is "bajando" (being cascaded) from top management through established rituals like "connections," "convenciones," and "town halls".

This suggests that while the concept is clearly defined and understood by leadership, its deep, operational-level penetration (i.e., _every_ collaborator living and understanding the "13 strategic axes" in detail) is a continuous effort. Therefore, while **executive knowledge is high**, the percentage of the _entire workforce_ that knows the "talisis Way" at a granular level of detail is likely still evolving, with mechanisms in place to foster broader adoption and understanding.

talisis's executives possess a clear and detailed understanding of the "talisis Way," actively incorporating it into their strategic planning and operational responsibilities. This comprehensive framework, akin to the organisation's "cultural DNA" and "fractal architecture," guides talisis's growth, quality, and human-centric approach.

o   ¿Viven el talisis Way en su día a día? ¿Lo ven como cultura de trabajo, como una herramienta de soporte al trabajo, o solamente lo llevan por se los piden?

The executives at talisis predominantly perceive the "talisis Way" as a deeply ingrained **work culture and the organisation's foundational DNA**, rather than merely a support tool or a mandate to be followed. This cultural framework guides their strategic thinking, operational methodologies, and human-centric approach, aiming for a profound and lasting impact on education and society.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the executives view and embody the "talisis Way":

**1. "talisis Way" as an Integral Culture and Organisational DNA:**

Many executives articulate the "talisis Way" as the core identity and guiding principles of talisis, deeply embedded in their daily operations and long-term vision.

- **Nicho Garza (CEO)** explicitly defines talisis's perspective: "TALISIS funciona como un organismo fractal donde los principios se replican en cada nivel". He states, "Nuestra cultura se resume en cinco principios que viven en cada rincón de nuestros 190 centros: Servicio, Crear el sueño, Mentalidad de dueño, Espíritu de equipo, Excelencia". He also mentions "Alineación Cultural Total: Cada colaborador viviendo los principios TALISIS" as a key project. This clearly positions the "talisis Way" as the fundamental cultural blueprint.
- **Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff)**, from the human capital perspective, sees his area as the "motor del de la actitud de la energía, y del mudo organizacional de talisis". He emphasises fostering "una cultura de desarrollo, en todos los ámbitos" and "una cultura con una disciplina de altos altas estándares en todo lo que hacemos. Siendo un ejemplo en todo talisis, en todas nuestras marcas". He directly links high-performance teams to "dentro de la cultura talisis el talisis Way".
- **Julián (Juan Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation)** refers to talisis's essence as "este ADN que es talisis cómo poder hacer que la gente realmente lo viva". He describes the "talisis" (the ecosystem) as encompassing "la cultura, nuestro talento, nuestros procesos, nuestros rituales, nuestra tecnología". His role is to design and sustain transformation until it "convertir en en cultura".
- **Mariel Serrano (Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence)** states that her team's role is to "empujar la cultura talisis Way" and has the "responsabilidad de impulsar nuestro propósito e identidad con autenticidad". She further stresses the importance of all members working "en sincronía alineados con una visión compartida que impulse el crecimiento y la excelencia" for "consolidarnos como líderes en educación y transformación social".

She explicitly mentions "la misión institucional o la y los principios tal y eh que como fortalecemos la vinculación Todo siempre en colaboración y en equipo una sola imagen, una un solo talis". She also values the "sentido de pertenencia" and "calidez humana" at the core of the organisation.
- **Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director)** views her purpose as contributing to "cumplir sueños y a transformar la vida de las personas", which is directly aligned with the "talisis Way" principles. She seeks to "generar cultura organizacional" through commitment and leading by example.
- **Joel Enriquez (CSO and Director of Strategic & Corporate Affairs)** views his work not just as a job but as a "proyecto de vida" that aims to "transformar a mi país en una sola generación". He sees his role as "un fundador de cultura organizacional", emphasising that culture is "una manera de ser, una manera de pensar, una una manera de eh diseñar y provocar el futuro que merecemos".
- **Marcela Valdez (Director of Administration & Finance)** integrates "promover la cultura talisis" as a key part of her area's mission. She also mentions "mentalidad de dueño con los propósitos de de Tallys, mentalidad de dueño excelencia, servicio, crear el sueño y el espíritu de equipo" as core aspects of the legacy.

**2. "talisis Way" as a Framework and Tool for Support and Operational Excellence:**

Beyond being a cultural identity, executives also describe the "talisis Way" as a practical framework, a set of methodologies, and tools that support daily work and drive efficiency.

- **Inge Ploennig (Director of Quality & Academic Accreditation)** provides a very concrete example. She details how "our talisis Way" incorporates "13 strategic axes" that are "cascadeado" (cascaded) down into "proyectos estratégicos y planes que se ejecutan en el campos para lograr esa misión". She highlights that this framework brings "orden," "organización," and "claridad" to institutional processes, measured by OKRs and KPIs. This demonstrates a clear application of the "talisis Way" as an operational tool.
- **Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer)** emphasises efficiency through "procesos muy ordenados, que permitan tener claridad desde el una admisión a la universidad hasta el momento que es egresado". His area "contribuye a que precisamente al ser que al hacer que sucedan las cosas" through alignment with "esas directrices, esos procesos, esos objetivos", indicating a structured approach to operations aligned with the overarching framework.
- **Carlos Granados (CIO)**, in his vision for AI agents, mentions "automatización inteligente" and "decisiones basadas en datos precisos y en tiempo real" to reduce bureaucracy and make processes agile and effective. While not directly naming the "talisis Way," his focus on structured, data-driven improvement aligns with its principles of "Excelencia" and efficiency.
- **Luis Ruiz (Software Development Manager)** describes his role as building "integraciones entre nuestros diferentes sistemas" and aims to reduce manual tasks through technology. This supports the "talisis Way" through technological enablement.
- **Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director)** speaks of "procesos más estandarizados que nos permitan comunicarnos de manera transversal," "compartiendo objetivos como son los OKRs," and "tener un lenguaje en común". She also mentions "workflows interáreas" and "dashboards abiertos que también estén estandarizados". This points to the "talisis Way" fostering operational alignment and efficiency through shared tools and processes.
- **Carlos Villa (Mobile Dev Lead)**, while focusing on mobile development, highlights the importance of well-developed applications with "good feeling" to make users "enamore de nuestro producto". This aligns with the "Servicio" principle and creating a positive experience for the student.
- **Román (Data Scientist)** describes using algorithms and data architecture to "construye soluciones personalizadas o motores de recomendación" and "dar visibilidad a la organización de manera oportuna para tomar decisiones más estratégicas". This is a direct application of data science to support the "talisis Way" principle of "Excelencia" through "eficiencia inteligente".

**3. Beyond Mere Compliance – A Driving Purpose:**

The interviews consistently demonstrate that executives engage with the "talisis Way" not out of obligation, but because they believe in its transformative power and inherent value.

- **Humberto (Commercial Area)** expresses deep satisfaction in seeing students "crecer profesionalmente, logra crecer como persona, y eso les ayuda a tener 1 mejor situación familiar, económica y profesional". This personal motivation aligns directly with the "talisis Way"'s fundamental purpose of "Transformar comunidades a través de las personas mediante educación accesible y pertinente que genere movilidad social sostenible y ciclos virtuosos de desarrollo transgeneracional".
- **Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer)** states his personal purpose as "dejar huella que trascienda con mi equipo, con mi rol, con con mi persona" and seeing "un crecimiento real en en las personas". He connects this to the "talisis Way" vision of "rompió las barreras entre educación formal y educación o o formación continua entre lo digital y lo humano". He views the projects as "puertas abiertas a una etapa de crecimiento, impacto social, liderazgo en la educación privada en en México y para países".
- **Paul Moch (VP for Teaching & Learning)** explicitly states his "propósito de vida ha sido pensar en cómo poder ayudar a que la educación sea un el gran factor transformador y de desarrollo de América Latina". This deep personal conviction reinforces that the "talisis Way" is lived, not just followed.
- **Katherine Romero (Senior Marketing Manager)** finds inspiration in "el propósito de talisis? Transformar comunidades a través de las personas". She sees her role as "guardián del propósito, cuidar que todo lo que se comunique esté alineado a la misión de talisis".
- **Juliana Effting (Director of Online Education)** is moved by "saber que hago una contribución positiva para el mundo y para las comunidades de México generando una transformación de vidas a través de de la educación". This personal drive goes far beyond simple compliance.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the executive interviews, the "talisis Way" is clearly understood and embraced as a **comprehensive cultural framework**. It is seen as the **organisational DNA** that defines who talisis is and how it operates, rather than just a set of rules imposed from above. It also functions as a **strategic and operational support tool**, providing clarity, structure, and a common language for decision-making, process improvement, and technological integration. Ultimately, for the executives, the "talisis Way" is **a living philosophy and a driving purpose** that genuinely inspires them and their teams to achieve a long-term, transformative impact on education and society. The consistent effort across different departments to align with and promote these principles demonstrates a profound commitment that goes well beyond mere compliance.

### III. Principales retos y oportunidades. ¿Qué les quita el sueño?

o   ¿Cuáles han sido los principales retos de talisis durante los últimos 3 años?

talisis has navigated a complex and rapidly evolving educational landscape over the past three years, facing a myriad of challenges that span technological, operational, cultural, and market-related domains. These challenges often interlink, demanding integrated and adaptive strategic responses from various departments across the organisation.

Here are the principal challenges talisis has encountered during the last three years:

**1. Digital Transformation & Technological Debt:** A significant hurdle has been the rapid pace of technological evolution, particularly in **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing**, and the subsequent need for talisis to integrate these advancements effectively while addressing existing technological debt.

- **Legacy Systems and Data Integration:** Many executives highlight issues with disparate systems that do not "speak to each other," leading to fragmented and unreliable data. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration & Finance, specifically notes the "lack of integration between systems (SAP/Core Banner) leading to open controls and discrepancies," which implies significant operational and financial risks. Román, a Data Scientist, also points out that "metrics definition not clear" and "platforms change, metrics change, hard to keep up with small team". This fragmentation hinders agile decision-making and efficient operations.
- **Pace of Technology Adoption:** There's a recognised slowness in adopting new technologies, including AI, within various areas. Luis Ruiz, Software Development Manager, mentions the "rapid technological advances... causes lagging". Carlos Granados, CIO, aims for full AI integration by 2033, indicating a long journey ahead for complete maturity. The challenge extends to "overcoming the fear of technology" and fostering a practice-oriented approach.
- **Automation and Efficiency:** While AI and cloud are seen as tools to simplify tasks, automate processes, and enhance efficiency, the current state often involves manual and bureaucratic processes that consume significant time and resources. Julián Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, specifically sees the "automation of processes (making them more effective, faster, intelligent, systematic)" as a key challenge.
- **Infrastructure Costs:** The migration to cloud technologies, while beneficial, brings "costs associated with cloud migration," which need careful management.

**2. Market & Customer Dynamics:** talisis operates in a highly competitive and evolving educational market, which poses challenges in terms of differentiation, customer engagement, and adapting to new learning paradigms.

- **Market Saturation and Competition:** The market is described as "saturated with many institutions, formats, promises," making it difficult to demonstrate "real differentiation". New "low-cost competitors" and the "emergence of new ETX" (educational technology companies) further intensify this challenge. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, highlights the "aggressive competition" in the growing education market.
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Students are increasingly behaving like "digital consumers," demanding "immediacy, comparison, personalisation, and social validation". There's a shift towards "micro-credentials" and "non-traditional education", which redefines the perception of "prestige" from years of study to "applicability and speed". Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional en UNID, notes that students expect the same "fluidity, personalization, omnichannel" experience as services like Spotify or Netflix.
- **Perception of Online Education:** There's an ongoing need to build trust and educate the market that "online education in Mexico also works, and can be accessible, flexible and of quality". A "negative perception that the student may have of the quality of online" is a critical risk.
- **Relevance of Offerings:** The rapid changes in technology mean that "before a student finishes their degree, the content, bibliography, needs to be updated". There's a challenge to ensure the "pertinence of academic programs" and think beyond current market offerings to what should be offered in 10-20 years.
- **Economic Context:** The "economic deceleration and the pressure for profitability" mean students are more focused than ever on the "cost-benefit relationship of their education". Marcela Valdez points out the direct impact of "complicated and recessive economic environments" on students' ability to pay, affecting enrollment and payment methods.

**3. Internal Organisational & Cultural Cohesion:** Challenges related to internal alignment, communication, and fostering a cohesive culture across a multi-brand organisation.

- **Resistance to Change:** A recurring theme is the "resistance to change" and adherence to "traditional processes". Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, notes that new initiatives "imply new ways of thinking and operating, stopping doing campaigns by intuition to work with data, automating processes that were 100% manual," which "usually generates a lot of friction".
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration & Siloed Operations:** There's a "lack of real collaboration between areas" leading to a "fragmented chain". Executives often highlight departments operating in "silos" or having "misaligned priorities", which impedes efficient project execution and a shared strategic direction. Juan Arenas, COO, states that "lack of prioritization and slow implementation" are critical challenges.
- **Multi-Brand Integration:** Integrating the distinct identities and cultures of different brands (U-ERRE, Harmon Hall, UNID, Advenio) within talisis is difficult. Álvaro García, Innovation & Product Director, highlights the need for talisis staff to "relate with the brands" not just as administrators but as clients or even teachers to understand daily student life.
- **Communication & Alignment:** Despite efforts like "Town Halls", there's a need for "clear, effective, and assertive communication". Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, highlights that the "talisis Bit" project faces obstacles if "collaborators don't understand, and, therefore, don't commit". Juan Mendez notes the challenge of making people "really live" the "talisis ADN" across all levels.

**4. Human Capital & Talent Management:** Ensuring the right talent is in place, adequately trained, and motivated to drive talisis's ambitious goals.

- **Talent Acquisition & Retention:** Challenges include "attracting the best talent" and being "rigorous" in hiring the right fit for each position. High turnover, especially among commercial advisors, is a concern, with long hiring times. Paul Moch, VP for Teaching & Learning, cites "lack of hands to develop many of my activities" as a key challenge.
- **Training & Upskilling:** There's a continuous need for employees to "develop abilities, especially soft skills" and "technological skills". Paulina Adalid mentions that students often arrive with "precarious knowledge" and "emotional and affective situations" post-pandemic, which requires teachers to be continuously trained and supported. Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, lists a vast array of technical and soft skills needed for her team to keep pace.
- **Productivity & Efficiency:** Domingo Farias notes the "lack of visibility of productivity" in many positions beyond commercial roles. He also points to the external challenge of "regulations changing... from 48 hours to 40 hours", which necessitates greater productivity in fewer hours.
- **Leadership Maturity:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, highlights that "talent retention and development... requires a certain maturity in our leaders, which... takes time". This maturity is crucial for leaders to embody the desired high-performance culture.
- **Union and Sociopolitical Factors:** Domingo Farias points out that "syndicates protect the employee disproportionately, and... do not allow... a culture of high standards of high performance to prosper". These factors can "wear out a lot" the negotiation processes.

**5. Financial & Operational Efficiency:** Managing resources, optimising investments, and ensuring sustainable growth in a complex environment.

- **Budgetary Constraints:** Many initiatives are limited by "lack of budget", and there's a constant need to "maximise scarce resources". Román, a Data Scientist, frequently mentions the need for a dedicated budget to expand his team and for continuous professional development.
- **Cost Management:** Marcela Valdez indicates a basic priority of "vigilating that the minimum cash flow is covered" and "not losing that minimum profitability". The "increase in marketing costs" across the market also presents a challenge.
- **Prioritisation and Focus:** There's a recognised issue of being "saturated with projects" that are "not necessarily all priorities", leading to a "lack of clear prioritisation". This makes it difficult to allocate "limited resources" effectively.
- **Operational Control for Growth:** Humberto highlights the need for "operational control before inorganic growth/expansion". The expansion of U-ERRE, for example, is linked to a significant "economic theme".
- **Measuring Impact:** While there's a strong desire to measure outcomes, challenges exist in having "clear measurement" for things like social media engagement or the true impact of marketing on educational decisions.

These challenges collectively underscore the complexity of transforming an educational institution like talisis in a rapidly changing world, highlighting the need for continuous adaptation, strong leadership, and strategic investments.

Next step: We could explore the specific opportunities that talisis executives identify as key enablers for overcoming these challenges.

- **System Fragmentation and Data Inconsistency:** A significant hurdle is the prevalence of disparate systems that do not interoperate seamlessly (e.g., SAP/Core Banner), leading to fragmented, unreliable data, and open controls that pose operational and financial risks. This lack of integration hinders agile decision-making and operational efficiency.
- **Pace of Technology Adoption vs. Market Speed:** Despite the recognised need for AI and cloud integration, there is a perceived slowness in adopting these new technologies across various departments. The rapid pace of technological change (e.g., generative AI models, quantum computing) means talisis risks "lagging" or being "left behind" if it cannot implement new technologies more quickly.
- **Automation of Manual Processes:** Many internal processes remain manual and bureaucratic, consuming significant time and resources. The challenge is to automate these processes to make them more effective, faster, intelligent, and systematic, freeing up human capital for higher-value tasks. Specific areas for automation include variable compensation calculations, and student-facing administrative tasks.
- **Infrastructure Costs and Scalability:** The transition to and maintenance of cloud technologies, while beneficial for asynchronous work and efficiency, incurs significant monthly costs that require careful management.
- **Data Quality and Centralisation:** There is a critical need for clearer metric definitions, higher quality data, and a consolidated data view across the organisation. The current lack of a well-designed master data system and periodic closures in core systems contribute to data discrepancies and control risks.

**2. Navigating Evolving Market Dynamics and Intense Competition:** talisis operates in a highly competitive educational market, requiring constant adaptation to new learning paradigms and customer expectations.

- **Market Saturation and Differentiation:** The market is "saturated with many institutions, formats, [and] promises," making it difficult to demonstrate "real differentiation". New low-cost competitors and emerging educational technology (EdTech) companies further intensify this challenge. The imperative is to design "unforgettable" offerings with tangible, differentiating value, communicated with clarity and emotion.
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Students are increasingly behaving like "digital consumers," demanding "immediacy, comparison, personalisation, and social validation". There is a shift towards "micro-credentials" and "non-traditional education," where "prestige" is redefined by "applicability and speed" rather than years of study. The challenge is to offer personalised experiences and develop what students _really_ need, rather than what the internal team assumes.
- **Perception of Online Education:** There is an ongoing need to build trust and educate the market that "online education in Mexico also works, and can be accessible, flexible and of quality". A "negative perception that the student may have of the quality of online" is a critical risk to overcome.
- **Relevance of Academic Offerings:** Due to rapid technological changes, academic content and bibliography become quickly outdated, even before a student completes their degree. The challenge is to ensure the "pertinence of academic programs" and to anticipate future needs (5, 10, 15, even 20 years ahead), rather than just reacting to current market offerings.
- **Increasing Marketing Costs and Saturation:** Marketing expenses are escalating across the market, not just in education, due to advertising saturation and digital fatigue. This necessitates more emotional and purpose-driven content to cut through the noise and foster community.

**3. Strengthening Internal Organisational and Cultural Cohesion:** Internal alignment, communication, and fostering a cohesive high-performance culture across a multi-brand organisation present significant challenges.

- **Resistance to Change:** A recurring theme is the "resistance to change" and adherence to "traditional processes". New initiatives, especially those involving data-driven approaches and automation, generate "friction" as they imply new ways of thinking and operating.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration and Siloed Operations:** A "lack of real collaboration between areas" leads to a "fragmented chain". Departments often operate in "silos" or have "misaligned priorities," impeding efficient project execution and a shared strategic direction. There is a need for clear processes and improved inter-area communication to avoid duplication and ensure alignment.
- **Multi-Brand Integration:** Integrating the distinct identities and cultures of different brands (U-ERRE, Harmon Hall, UNID, Advenio) within talisis is difficult and requires significant effort to achieve a unified vision and operational synergy.
- **Cultural Adoption of "talisis ADN":** A key internal challenge is ensuring that all collaborators "really live" the "talisis ADN" – its purpose, values, and principles. This involves communicating effectively and fostering commitment from within the organisation. The talisis Bit project aims to address this by synchronising communication and actions across all areas.
- **Project Prioritisation:** The organisation is "saturated with projects" that are "not necessarily all priorities," leading to a "lack of clear prioritisation". This makes it difficult to allocate limited resources effectively and shifts focus from strategic long-term initiatives to short-term "firefighting".

**4. Optimising Human Capital and Talent Management:** Ensuring the right talent is in place, adequately trained, and motivated is crucial for talisis's ambitious goals.

- **Talent Acquisition and Retention:** Challenges include "attracting the best talent" and being "rigorous" in hiring the right fit for each position. High turnover, especially among commercial advisors, is a concern, with long hiring times (40-50 days). Retaining and empowering teachers is also a critical challenge.
- **Training and Upskilling for New Demands:** There is a continuous need for employees to develop new skills, particularly in AI, digital tools, analytics, and soft skills (communication, empathy, critical thinking). This requires continuous training, often needing dedicated budgets and time for professional development.
- **Productivity and Efficiency:** There is a "lack of visibility of productivity" in many non-commercial positions, and the shift to fewer working hours (e.g., 40-hour week) necessitates greater productivity in less time. Additionally, reducing the time it takes for new advisors to reach optimal productivity (currently 7 months) is a target.
- **Leadership Maturity:** Developing and retaining talent "requires a certain maturity in our leaders, which... takes time". This leadership maturity is crucial for leaders to embody the desired high-performance culture and effectively manage their teams.
- **Student Support Needs:** Students, particularly post-pandemic, are arriving with "precarious knowledge" and "emotional and affective situations" that require teachers to be continuously trained and supported to address these evolving needs.

**5. Addressing Financial Pressures and Operational Efficiency:** Managing resources effectively, optimising investments, and ensuring sustainable growth in a complex environment are ongoing challenges.

- **Budgetary Constraints and Profitability Pressure:** Many initiatives are limited by "lack of budget," and there is a constant need to "maximise scarce resources". The "economic deceleration and the pressure for profitability" mean students are more focused than ever on the "cost-benefit relationship of their education". A basic priority is "vigilating that the minimum cash flow is covered" and "not losing that minimum profitability".
- **Funding Strategic Initiatives:** Key strategic projects, such as the Promecap exit, U-ERRE's expansion, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), face significant economic challenges related to capital and debt raising, and generating sufficient EBITDA.
- **Optimising Cost Distribution:** The focus is not just on reducing costs, but on "efficiently distributing" them across necessary categories, making strategic use of technology to achieve this.

**6. Navigating External Regulatory and Socio-political Factors:** External macro-environmental factors significantly influence talisis's operations and strategic direction.

- **Labour Regulations and Union Influence:** Changes in labour regulations (e.g., reduced working hours) demand increased productivity. Moreover, socio-political factors and union influences in Mexico are seen as challenging, as "syndicates protect the employee disproportionately, and... do not allow... a culture of high standards of high performance to prosper," leading to draining negotiation processes.
- **Socio-economic and Security Context:** The overall socio-economic situation in Mexico directly impacts families' ability to invest in education, affecting new enrollments and payment methods. Security concerns in regions where talisis has a presence also pose a challenge.
- **AI Regulation and Ethics:** The nascent regulatory framework for AI, particularly concerning data protection and ethics, presents an evolving challenge. talisis needs to ensure compliance and operate ethically as it integrates AI more deeply into its educational ecosystem.

These challenges collectively highlight the dynamic environment in which talisis operates. Addressing them effectively will require continuous adaptation, strong leadership, strategic investments, and a concerted effort to foster an agile and purpose-driven culture.

Based on this comprehensive overview of challenges, we could now discuss potential strategic recommendations for talisis to mitigate these risks and transform them into opportunities, focusing on which challenges should be prioritised in 2025.

The "Consolidación cultural" phase (2025-2027) highlights internal alignment, communication, and fostering a cohesive high-performance culture across a multi-brand organisation as significant hurdles.

- **Resistance to Change:** A recurring theme is the "resistance to change" and adherence to "traditional processes" [Alejandro 52; Juan Mendez 340; Katherine 231; Juliana 366; Paulina 576]. New, data-driven initiatives or automation often generate "friction" as they imply new ways of thinking and operating, challenging the "if it worked before, why change it?" mentality [Katherine 231].
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration and Siloed Operations:** A "lack of real collaboration between areas" leads to a "fragmented chain" [Katherine 231]. Departments frequently operate in "silos" or have "misaligned priorities," impeding efficient project execution and a shared strategic direction [Katherine 231; Lilian 439; Mariel 538; Román 592, 615, 616].
- **Multi-Brand Integration:** Integrating the distinct identities and cultures of different brands (U-ERRE, Harmon Hall, UNID, Advenio) within talisis is a complex endeavour, requiring significant effort to achieve a unified vision and operational synergy [Juan Arenas 324].
- **Fostering a High-Performance Culture and Ownership:** There's a challenge in instilling a consistent culture of accountability, proactivity, and high performance ("talisis ADN") across all levels of the organisation [Domingo 163, 168, 195, 198; Amalia 114; Juan Arenas 324]. This includes developing leadership maturity to effectively manage and motivate teams [Amalia 114].
- **Project Prioritisation and Focus:** The organisation often finds itself "saturated with projects" that "are not necessarily all priorities," leading to a lack of clear focus and resource dispersion [Domingo 190; Juan Arenas 325; Juan Mendez 340; Lilian 439]. This can result in short-term "firefighting" rather than strategic long-term initiatives [Lilian 439, 440].

### 3. Market Adaptability and Relevance

talisis operates in a highly competitive educational market, necessitating constant adaptation to new learning paradigms and evolving customer expectations.

- **Market Saturation and Differentiation:** The market is "saturated with many institutions, formats, [and] promises" [Katherine 223, 227], making it difficult to demonstrate "real differentiation" [Katherine 223]. New low-cost competitors and emerging EdTech companies further intensify this challenge [Álvaro 88; Juan Arenas 320; Juliana 363, 366]. The imperative is to design "unforgettable" offerings with tangible, differentiating value [Katherine 223, 227].
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Students are increasingly behaving like "digital consumers," demanding "immediacy, comparison, personalisation, and social validation" [Katherine 222, 227]. There's a shift towards "micro-credentials" and "non-traditional education," where "prestige" is redefined by "applicability and speed" rather than years of study [Katherine 222, 227].
- **Perception of Online Education:** There is an ongoing need to build trust and educate the market that "online education in Mexico also works, and can be accessible, flexible and of quality" [Juliana 363]. Overcoming the "negative perception that the student may have of the quality of online" is a critical risk to overcome [Juliana 366].
- **Relevance of Academic Offerings:** Due to rapid technological changes, academic content and bibliography can become quickly outdated [Inge 268, 269]. The challenge is to ensure the "pertinence of academic programs" and to anticipate future needs [Inge 269].
- **Increasing Marketing Costs:** Marketing expenses are escalating across the market, not just in education, due to advertising saturation and digital fatigue, leading to higher costs per lead (CPL) [Alberto 23, 24; Katherine 435; Lilian 435]. This demands more emotional and purpose-driven content to cut through the noise [Lilian 435].

### 4. Human Capital Development and Management

Ensuring the right talent is in place, adequately trained, and motivated is crucial for talisis's ambitious goals.

- **Talent Acquisition and Retention:** Challenges include "attracting the best talent" and being "rigorous" in hiring the right fit for each position, with past "staffing errors" highlighted [Domingo 195]. High turnover, especially among commercial advisors, is a concern, with long hiring times (40-50 days) [Domingo 178]. Retaining and empowering teachers is also a critical challenge [Alejandro 58, 61].
- **Training and Upskilling for New Demands:** There is a continuous need for employees to develop new skills, particularly in AI, digital tools, analytics, and soft skills (communication, empathy, critical thinking) [Angel 122; Juan Arenas 313; Paul 551, 552; Paulina 572; Román 609]. This requires continuous training, often needing dedicated budgets and time for professional development [Lilian 439; Román 609].
- **Productivity Measurement and Efficiency:** There is a "lack of visibility of productivity" in many non-commercial positions [Domingo 181]. The trend towards reduced working hours (e.g., 40-hour week in Mexico) necessitates greater productivity in less time [Domingo 181]. Reducing the time it takes for new advisors to reach optimal productivity (currently 7 months) is a specific target [Domingo 177].
- **Student Preparedness and Support:** Students, particularly post-pandemic, are arriving with "precarious knowledge" and "emotional and affective situations" that require teachers to be continuously trained and supported to address these evolving needs [Paulina 570, 571].

### 5. Financial Stability and Resource Management

Managing resources effectively, optimising investments, and ensuring sustainable growth in a complex environment are ongoing challenges.

- **Budgetary Constraints and Profitability Pressure:** Many initiatives are limited by "lack of budget," and there is a constant need to "maximise scarce resources" [Marcela 463]. The "economic deceleration and the pressure for profitability" mean students are more focused than ever on the "cost-benefit relationship of their education" [Katherine 223, 227; Marcela 483]. A basic priority is "vigilating that the minimum cash flow is covered" and "not losing that minimum profitability" [Marcela 483]. This implies a critical balance between short-term financial health and long-term strategic investments [Marcela 483].
- **Optimising Cost Distribution:** The focus is not just on reducing costs, but on "efficiently distributing" them across necessary categories, making strategic use of technology to achieve this [Alberto 26; Alejandro 63].

### 6. External Regulatory and Socio-Political Factors

External macro-environmental factors significantly influence talisis's operations and strategic direction.

- **Labour Regulations and Union Influence:** Changes in labour regulations (e.g., reduced working hours) demand increased productivity [Domingo 181]. Moreover, socio-political factors and union influences in Mexico are seen as challenging, as "syndicates protect the employee disproportionately, and... do not allow... a culture of high standards of high performance to prosper," leading to draining negotiation processes [Domingo 188; Amalia 112].
- **Socio-Economic and Security Context:** The overall socio-economic situation in Mexico directly impacts families' ability to invest in education, affecting new enrolments and payment methods [Alberto 18; Marcela 482]. Security concerns in regions where talisis has a presence also pose a challenge to operations and reputation [Alberto 18; Marcela 482].
- **AI Regulation and Ethics:** The nascent regulatory framework for AI, particularly concerning data protection and ethics (e.g., NOM 037, GDPR/LGPD) presents an evolving challenge. talisis needs to ensure compliance and operate ethically as it integrates AI more deeply into its educational ecosystem [Angel 127, 125; Román 625].
- **Broader Economic and Social Shifts:** Global economic models, the rise of the digital economy (e.g., cryptocurrencies), and the changing function of universities in society are broader trends that require rethinking the institutional role and academic offerings [Marcos 510, 511].

These challenges collectively highlight the dynamic environment in which talisis operates. Addressing them effectively over the 2025-2027 period will require continuous adaptation, strong and aligned leadership, strategic investments, and a concerted effort to foster an agile and purpose-driven culture.

Given the emphasis on "Consolidación tecnológica y cultural" for 2025-2027, we could now delve into specific strategic recommendations for talisis to overcome the identified challenges related to data quality, process automation, and internal cultural resistance, and discuss how these actions could build a foundation for subsequent phases of expansion and leadership.

The recurring themes across various areas underscore a commitment to data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and a holistic view of value creation, extending beyond immediate financial returns to encompass long-term societal impact and educational transformation.

Given the emphasis on data and analytics across various roles (e.g., Román, Luis, Marcela, Katherine, Julián, Inge), a valuable next step would be to explore the current state of data infrastructure and analytics capabilities at talisis. Specifically, you might consider asking: "What are the current limitations or challenges in collecting, integrating, and analyzing data across different departments and systems to support these diverse performance indicators, and what technological investments or strategic initiatives are planned to overcome them?"

o   ¿Son los mismos indicadores o diferentes para cada nivel organizacional?

talisis employs a comprehensive and interconnected approach to its indicators, which, while varying in specificity across organisational levels, are fundamentally aligned with overarching strategic objectives. This is consistent with the description of talisis functioning as a "fractal organism where the principles replicate at each level".

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

**1. Overarching Organisational Metrics:** At the highest level, talisis uses a set of "Metrics of Organizational Success" that apply across the entire entity. These include:

- Growth in sales and EBITDA.
- Students titled/certified.
- Employability and educational ROI.
- Longitudinal impact on communities.
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) and satisfaction.

Several leaders confirm the focus on these high-level metrics. Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) explicitly links his area's success to the "results of the company," mentioning growth, income, profitability, and product quality. Marcela (Finance) also emphasises overall profitability, new enrolments (NI), and re-enrolments as key indicators. Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer) echoes this, listing growth in new income, total enrolment, average ticket, student satisfaction, operating margin, and graduate employment/salary as critical success measures.

**2. Departmental and Area-Specific Indicators:** While the high-level goals remain consistent, each department or functional area defines and tracks more granular indicators relevant to its specific responsibilities and contributions. These detailed metrics are designed to feed into and support the broader organisational objectives, ensuring a cascaded alignment.

- **Finance (Alberto Sánchez, Marcela):** Beyond overall profitability, Alberto's area tracks financial ratios like debt-to-equity, interest-to-EBITDA, and EBITDA-to-debt for specific projects like Promecap, along with cash flow and financial health for mergers and acquisitions. Marcela's indicators include days of accounts receivable/payable, inventory days, and campus utilisation percentage, along with new and re-enrolments.
- **Academic and Quality (Alejandro, Inge, Marcos, Paul):**
    - Alejandro focuses on "NPS docente" (teacher NPS), fulfilment of "promise of value," generation size, and extracurricular value.
    - Inge (Quality and Accreditation) focuses on achieving specific accreditation levels (e.g., 7 years for UNID), and integrating key academic indicators within the OKRs and KPIs reviewed in monthly meetings to track continuous improvement.
    - Marcos (Academic Operations) monitors the advancement of specific metrics within automated dashboards to ensure operational processes are being followed.
    - Paul (Teaching & Learning) measures the development of 21st-century skills, educational quality (through standardised tests), student employability, overall student growth, and retention of qualified teaching staff.
- **Operations (Juan Arenas):** Focuses on the tangible outputs of execution, such as new income and enrolment growth, student satisfaction, and sales efficiency.
- **Marketing and Growth (Fernando, Katherine, Lilian):**
    - Fernando's area tracks cost of acquisition per student, conversion rates by channel, funnel automation, and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
    - Katherine (Senior Marketing Manager) and Lilian (Digital Marketing Director) also use metrics like CPL, CTR, engagement, and the adoption/standardisation of internal processes and AI usage within their marketing efforts.
- **Human Capital and Transformation (Domingo, Julián):**
    - Domingo measures the "organisational mood," including employee engagement and quality of life, alongside the NPS of leaders.
    - Julián (Operational Planning and Transformation) tracks institutional digital maturity (with levels from implementation to quality execution), the percentage of automated processes, and the alignment of projects to the 2035 vision.
- **Strategic Affairs and Reputation (Joel, Mariel):**
    - Joel (CSO) notes that reputation is a long-term indicator, measured by the perception of all stakeholders, including clients, students, authorities, and employees.
    - Mariel (Corporate Reputation) uses compliance percentages across project phases (conceptualisation, model, planning, deployment, execution) to measure the success of the "Talysis Bit" project, which aims to align and synchronise the entire company.
- **Technology and Data Science (Carlos, Luis, Román):**
    - Carlos (CIO) measures the adoption of AI solutions, data quality, and user satisfaction (NPS by solution).
    - Luis (focused on data integrations) tracks project progress, the percentage of user understanding (of students, teachers, and administrators), and survey feedback, also expecting improvements in retention and attraction metrics due to AI.
    - Román (Data Scientist) measures the agility of decision-making, the number of departments and processes utilising AI, the reduction of manual reports, and the decrease in student desertion risk.

**3. Cascading and Alignment as a Core Principle:** The overall strategy in talisis is to ensure that all levels and areas are working towards a common goal, even if their specific daily metrics differ.

- Inge highlights a "cascade" from the institutional mission down to OKRs and KPIs, with continuous measurement to drive improvement.
- The "Talysis Bit" project, mentioned by Joel and Mariel, serves as a transversal initiative to "align, synchronise, and set the rhythm" of the company, ensuring that all efforts contribute to achieving short, medium, and long-term objectives. This project involves clear phases and measurable compliance percentages, demonstrating a structured approach to unified execution.
- Julián also underscores that the implementation of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) ensures that the organisation has "clear objectives that are measurable" and is "talking about what is truly important".

While the specific indicators will vary depending on the function and level of granularity, talisis maintains a robust framework where departmental metrics are aligned to and support the broader strategic objectives and organisational success metrics, functioning as a cohesive, "fractal" system.

o   ¿Cuáles han sido los cambios más relevantes durante los últimos 12 meses?

talisis has undergone significant and relevant changes over the last 12 to 24 months, indicating a dynamic evolution across its organisational structure, operational processes, technological adoption, and strategic focus. These changes are largely driven by a forward-looking vision for 2035 and a proactive approach to market demands and technological advancements.

Here are the most relevant changes observed, elaborated with details from the sources:

Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) notes that AI is already transforming his processes, helping to structure, rethink, and bounce ideas, acting as a "consolidator and organiser of all the information" to aid decision-making and enhance student learning. Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) highlights his personal daily use of AI for productivity, indicating a shift in individual work habits. Alejandro Madrazo (Academic Director) believes AI and cloud technology should be at the "centre of the process of reimagining educational institutions in their totality," affecting not only processes but inspiring new pedagogies and epistemologies. Román (Data Scientist) expects AI to allow for the production of "personalised didactic content in minutes" and automate "exam-type questions and adaptive feedback".
- **Process Automation**: There's a clear push to automate manual, repetitive, and time-consuming processes using AI and digital tools. Examples include variable compensation calculations, advisor onboarding and training, and recruitment in high-turnover positions, which Domingo Farias identifies as key next steps for AI. Julián (Operational Planning and Transformation) explicitly states that "during the last years and more I believe the last one, we have seen extraordinary changes in the topic of artificial intelligence". Marcela (Finance) also seeks to simplify daily activities like bank reconciliations and financial analysis through AI. Juan Arenas (COO) aims to use AI to "efficientar los procesos a lo largo del viaje del estudiante desde antes que inicie hasta que se gradúe," automating manual activities to reduce errors and save time.
- **Enhanced Data Utilisation and Infrastructure**: talisis is moving towards becoming a truly data-driven organisation. Carlos (Mobile Development) is developing a tool to track real-time app usage (screens and buttons) to better understand user behaviour, moving away from assumptions. Román (Data Scientist) describes a priority to create an integral data infrastructure to collect comprehensive information on students, teachers, and administrators, and deploy machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and make "more strategic" decisions. Luis (Data Integrations) highlights the goal of achieving "more detailed and profound analysis of the information we currently have about our students," and maturing in the use of machine learning and AI to deliver quality and personalised services. Fernando (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) envisions decisions made based on "insights and data" rather than intuition. Katherine (Marketing) stresses the importance of "listening to the student of the future" through various data collection methods, aiming to evolve brands based on their aspirations and needs. Mariel (Corporate Reputation) discusses using "KPIs reputacionales basados en data," including brand sentiment, authority scores, and digital engagement, for real-time reputation evaluation.
- **Shift to Cloud Technology**: The adoption of Cloud technology is seen as crucial for making the same data available to everyone securely, enabling more agile decision-making across campuses and programs. Álvaro García (Innovation and Product) notes that AI and Cloud will enable greater control, agility, and automation, facilitating simpler decisions and better market knowledge.
- **Mobile-First Strategy**: Mobile applications are increasingly used by students over web browsers. This has led Carlos's team to implement in-app rating components to gather direct feedback and boost app store ratings, reflecting a recent emphasis on the mobile user experience.

**2. Maturation and Increased Clarity in Organisational Processes and Strategic Direction**

- **Improved Organisational Structure and Focus**: Inge Ploennig (Quality) observes a "much greater organisation, greater clarity of focus on where we are going and how we should achieve it" over the past two years. This is manifested in more systematised rituals and clearer information flow from top management through "connections, conventions, and town halls," which have "matured immensely".
- **Implementation of OKRs**: Julián (Operational Planning) reports that the organisation is actively implementing and refining OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). This ensures "clear objectives that are measurable" and helps the organisation focus on "what is truly important," suggesting a more disciplined approach to goal setting. Inge Ploennig also links quality management to OKRs and KPIs.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making Culture**: Multiple leaders, including Fernando, Román, Julián, Katherine, and Marcela, underscore a shift towards making decisions based on "insights and data" rather than intuition. This is supported by efforts to centralise dashboards and improve data quality.
- **Enhanced Inter-Area Collaboration**: While still an area for improvement, Inge Ploennig acknowledges that overall, there's been a "much greater organisation" and "clarity of focus" in how various departments contribute. Efforts are being made to "improve inter-area communication for collaborative projects," especially to avoid duplication and integrate different processes. The need for clear, documented processes and agile access to information to avoid friction between areas is highlighted by multiple interviewees.
- **Strategic Planning and Foresight**: Alberto Sánchez (Planning Director) emphasises that by 2035, planning must be market-centric, aligning financial and strategic structures with market trends and CAPEX needs. talisis aims to have a "capacity of foresight to see 5, 10, 15 years ahead of what the world is", moving beyond immediate reactions to proactively adapt programmes and detect new skills.

**3. Evolution of Educational Models and Student Experience**

- **Shift Towards Hybrid and Personalised Learning**: Juan Arenas (COO) explicitly states the intention to "migrate more to hybrid education" and make it "more personalised," moving beyond a solely online focus. Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) also identifies micro-credentials and hybrid models as key adaptations to future demographic and regulatory changes, advocating for a profound rethinking of the educational model. Paulina (UNID) states that talisis is "implementing the use of different learning platforms together with the experience of our teachers, always ensuring that academic quality is up-to-date and impacts student knowledge". Román (Data Scientist) is working on "personalised learning, understanding areas of opportunity in the academic and professional development of each student to recommend relevant academic content".
- **Student-Centric Design**: Katherine (Marketing) stresses the importance of "listening to the student of the future" through various data collection methods, aiming to evolve brands based on their aspirations and needs. Juliana (Online Direction) emphasises the need to actively "survey, know, and ask" students, acknowledging that past processes often "dominate" over the "customer's need". Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations) highlights the move towards "designing processes that are part of a complete experience" for students, aiming for "wow moments" that are unforgettable.
- **Focus on Comprehensive Skill Development**: Paul Moch and Paulina (UNID) highlight the development of 21st-century competencies, including soft skills, critical thinking, social responsibility, and humanistic values, as a central part of the educational offering, preparing students for an evolving world beyond just technical knowledge. This is also reflected in the "Reporte_Nicho" which states "The learning of the future that we are already creating is one where... personal purpose guides professional development, curiosity is worth more than memorisation".

**4. Strategic Market Approach and External Relations**

- **Proactive Market Vigilance**: Alberto Sánchez reiterates the need for continuous vigilance over market trends, including mergers and acquisitions, to ensure financial and strategic alignment. Fernando (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) emphasises the ambition for talisis's brands to "evolve before the market" by anticipating trends. Joel (Chief Strategic Officer) highlights his role in reading the "context" to design adaptable but solid, local and global strategies.
- **Increased Emphasis on B2B and Alliances**: Álvaro García (Innovation and Product) envisions talisis as a key strategic partner for corporate and public organisations, providing talent transformation and change management solutions, beyond just B2C. Multiple leaders underscore the growing importance of building and strengthening external alliances with educational institutions, companies, and government bodies.
- **Internationalisation and Regional Expansion**: talisis aims for an international impact, not limited to Mexico, potentially leveraging AI for content customisation to other languages and realities. Mariel (Corporate Reputation) aspires for talisis to be a "leading educational ecosystem in Mexico, but also for all of Latin America". Humberto (Commercial Area) also mentions the "apertura de nuevos centros de aprendizaje" and "exploring the expansion of UERRE" regionally.
- **Nearshoring and Tourism Opportunities**: Álvaro García identifies the nearshoring trend and the upcoming North American World Cup as significant opportunities for talent development and tourism sector professionalisation.

**5. Internal Culture and Talent Development Initiatives**

- **High-Performance Culture**: Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) identifies "High-Performance Culture" as a priority project, aiming to "optimise human resources" by attracting the "best talent" and ensuring proper internal staffing, addressing past "errors of staffing". This includes fostering "change management" capabilities, which were previously lacking. Amalia (Human Capital) focuses on "securing the best talent within the company" to deliver on the value proposition.
- **Leadership Development and Transparency**: Amalia (Human Capital) focuses on supporting leaders in evaluating, identifying, and developing their teams. Domingo Farias aims to provide leaders with clearer visibility into their teams' skills and areas for improvement. The use of a recruitment platform that offers real-time visibility on candidate status to hiring managers is a concrete example of this.
- **Focus on Employee Well-being and Engagement**: Domingo Farias measures the "organisational mood," including employee engagement and quality of life, through indicators like Net Promoter Score (NPS) of leaders, signifying a conscious effort to improve internal culture. Mariel (Corporate Reputation) links internal pride and belonging to external reputation.
- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation for Teams**: Alberto Sánchez (Planning) stresses the importance of the team evolving in digital and technology aspects, acknowledging that knowledge without technology is insufficient today. Lilian (Digital Marketing) highlights "LifeLong Learning" and constant adaptation to new technologies and market trends for her team. Paulina (UNID) stresses the "responsibility of training ourselves and learning new things every day".

**6. Operational Efficiency and Cost Management**

- **Optimised Resource Allocation**: Alberto Sánchez (Planning) points to the need for efficient administration of debt, capital raising, and resource allocation across costs and expenses to support long-term goals. He also mentions optimising payroll expenses with technology, rather than necessarily reducing them.
- **Marketing Expense Management**: Alberto Sánchez identifies the increasing costs of marketing in the general market, not just education, as a challenge, requiring efficient management of these expenses.
- **Addressing Legacy Systems and Data Fragmentation**: Marcela (Finance) identifies that while SAP was implemented years ago, it is "underutilised" and lacks interfaces, creating "disconnection" and "lack of control" between systems like Core Banner and SAP. This fragmented data environment means much information gathering is manual and time-consuming. This issue is a recurring theme, with Román also mentioning "too many systems that work in isolation, which leads to data inconsistencies".

The past 12-24 months at talisis have been characterised by an intensive digital transformation, particularly driven by AI and data. This technological push is intertwined with a strategic refinement of educational models towards hybrid and personalised learning, a more proactive and data-informed market approach, and a deliberate cultivation of an internal high-performance culture with a strong emphasis on talent development and improved leadership. While progress has been notable, the organisation continues to grapple with challenges related to full technological integration and overcoming ingrained traditional processes, all viewed through the lens of preparing for a future-ready educational ecosystem by 2035.

Given the pervasive mention of both the opportunities and the _challenges_ related to technological integration and data fragmentation across various systems and departments, it would be highly beneficial to delve into a comprehensive analysis of talisis's current IT architecture. This analysis could identify key bottlenecks, assess the interoperability of existing platforms (e.g., SAP, Core Banner, marketing automation, student-facing apps), and propose a phased roadmap for a more unified, scalable, and data-driven technological ecosystem. This would directly address the concerns raised by multiple leaders about fragmented data, manual processes, and slow decision-making due to technological limitations, acting as a crucial enabler for many of the strategic changes discussed.
### IV. Objetivos y Proyectos/Iniciativas Estratégicas

o   ¿Cuáles fueron los objetivos para el año 2023 y 2024?

While explicit, detailed annual objectives solely for 2023 and 2024 are not exhaustively outlined by every interviewee in the provided sources, several leaders describe current or "in process" initiatives and short-term priorities that would undoubtedly constitute the strategic objectives and projects for these years. Marcela, from Finance, offers the most direct insight into immediate financial priorities for the current year.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the objectives and strategic projects/initiatives inferred and explicitly mentioned for the 2023-2024 period:

### I. Explicit Short-Term Financial Objectives (Marcela)

Marcela, Director of Administration and Finance, clearly articulates a critical short-term objective for "this year":

- **Cash Flow Management and Debt Recovery**: The primary goal is to diligently monitor and ensure the minimum cash flow is covered. Given the challenges presented "in a year with the challenges with which we present ourselves", a basic priority is the recovery of the portfolio (accounts receivable). The aim is to prevent any decline in the minimum profitability that has been set. This implies that some projects, although promising for the future, might be delayed due to the immediate need to safeguard short-term financial stability.
- **Information Management and Controls**: To support this, there is a focus on having financial information available more promptly, providing visibility in advance, and implementing controls to prevent financial setbacks or significant impacts. There is also a need to measure and manage scholarships effectively. Marcela also specifically mentioned the current goal of automating financial processes like "conciliar las transacciones financieras de la venta a la cobranza, el pago al reconocimiento del ingreso de forma más efectiva con apoyo de la inteligencia artificial" and improving the management of financial and productivity information.

### II. Foundational Layer: Purpose and Culture-Driven Definition

At its core, objective definition at talisis is driven by a shared purpose and an intentional organisational culture:

1. **Anchoring in Fundamental Purpose**: The ultimate purpose is "Transformar comunidades a través de las personas mediante educación accesible y pertinente que genere movilidad social sostenible y ciclos virtuosos de desarrollo transgeneracional". This profound purpose inspires leaders across the organisation, such as Alberto Sánchez, who sees it as contributing to "un mejor México", and Amalia Ortega, who is motivated by helping to "cumplir sueños y a transformar la vida de las personas". This purpose acts as the non-negotiable foundation for all objectives.
2. **Cultivating a High-Performance Culture**: A critical strategic initiative, championed by the Chief of Staff, Domingo Farias, is fostering a "cultura de alto desempeño" (High-Performance Culture). This involves establishing high standards, rigorously attracting and retaining the "best fit" talent, and embedding development in every leader's DNA. This cultural objective directly influences how other objectives are defined and pursued.
3. **The talisis Way and talisis Bit**: The "talisis Way" represents the company's core principles and identity. To ensure alignment and synchronicity across the entire organisation, a transversal project called "Talysis Bit" is being implemented. Described as a "Business Management Plan Integral" and "un proyecto de alineación, sincronización y un business management plan que nos llevará a todos estar alineados y ir con el ritmo adecuado, constante para llegar y lograr nuestros objetivos. A largo, mediano, y corto plazo", talisis Bit is _the_ mechanism to mark the rhythm of the company and ensure every area works towards shared objectives. This project aims to integrate objectives across all functions and timeframes, making alignment a continuous process.

### III. Strategic Planning and Market Alignment

Objective definition involves a sophisticated interplay between internal capabilities and external market demands:

1. **Market Intelligence and Foresight**: The Planning Director, Alberto Sánchez, highlights the need for planning to be "centrada en en lo que el mercado requiere en las tendencias de mercado". This involves internal analysis of what programs, courses, modalities, and sales channels the market seeks, as well as external monitoring for mergers and acquisitions opportunities. Similarly, the Chief Growth and Marketing Officer, Fernando, stresses "impulsando una visión clara del mercado, del estudiante del futuro" and adapting strategies based on "cambio de comportamiento del consumidor," "educación no tradicional o micro credenciales," and "consumerización de la experiencia educativa".
2. **Financial Structuring and Resource Allocation**: The Finance Director, Marcela, underlines her area's mission to "liderar la planificación presupuestaria el análisis de indicadores clave para mejorar la eficiencia de rentabilidad". Her team acts as "Enablers" from the back office to ensure that administrative and financial processes (such as invoicing, expense management, and resource allocation) are well-designed and aligned with new products, formats, and channels. This ensures that financial objectives are not only set but also enable the achievement of other strategic goals, carefully balancing short-term cash flow with long-term prosperity.
3. **Project Prioritisation**: Strategic projects are seen as the "iniciativas estratégicas interconectadas que materializan la visión". These projects are identified to drive the strategy forward, ranging from a unified student acquisition model and multibrand presence to AI integration and talent development. The CIO, Carlos Granados, defines initial projects like chatbots and administrative assistants, aligning them with the long-term vision of an "ecosistema educativo inteligente".

### IV. Operationalisation and Measurement

Translating strategic direction into actionable objectives is crucial:

1. **OKR Implementation**: Julián Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, is actively involved in implementing and refining the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system. This methodology is seen as key to ensuring "objetivos claros, que sean medibles, que realmente estemos hablando en toda la organización de lo que realmente es importante". This standardises how objectives are defined and tracked across the organisation.
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Román, a Data Scientist, emphasizes designing and implementing a data architecture for a "vista 360 de nuestros clientes" and providing "visibilidad a la organización de manera oportuna para tomar decisiones más estratégicas". Data dashboards, predictive algorithms, and real-time analytics are critical tools for setting and adjusting objectives, allowing for agile decision-making and continuous improvement.
3. **Continuous Feedback and Improvement Cycles**: Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, highlights that his team not only implements academic designs but also performs "mediciones [y] análisis de esas mediciones" to provide feedback to process designers for continuous improvement. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Accreditation, confirms this, stating that her area focuses on measuring "cumplimiento de la misión" through clear indicators and regular reviews, driving a "ciclo de mejora".

### V. Iterative Adaptation and Agility

The process acknowledges the dynamic nature of the environment:

1. **Flexibility and Re-evaluation**: Román notes the importance of a "mentalidad rígida" for the area, always being "dispuestos a reevaluar o reimplementar algo de lo que hayamos desarrollado". This agility allows objectives to be adjusted as external conditions or internal learnings evolve.
2. **Process Documentation and Standardisation**: Alejandro, from an unspecified area (likely academic or design), highlights the fundamental need for "procesos muy claros y muy previsibles" to avoid emergencies and allow focus on innovation and design. Marcos Samaniego also wishes for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos" to improve communication and order across the large organisation. This standardisation, while seemingly rigid, in fact supports agility by making processes predictable and easier to adapt.

The process for defining objectives at talisis is comprehensive and integrated:

- It starts with a **clear, long-term vision** and overarching strategic horizons.
- It is **purpose and culture-driven**, with initiatives like talisis Bit ensuring deep organisational alignment and synchronicity.
- It involves **strategic planning** informed by meticulous market intelligence and robust financial management.
- **Operationalisation** is achieved through methodologies like OKRs and supported by a growing reliance on data architecture and advanced analytics for **measurement and continuous feedback**.
- Finally, the entire process is designed to be **iterative and adaptive**, recognising the need for flexibility in a fast-changing world.

To further refine the objective definition process, it would be beneficial to conduct workshops that specifically map the "talisis Bit" implementation phases to the granular OKR setting process in key departments (e.g., Marketing, Academic Operations, Sales). This would help identify potential bottlenecks in the cascading of objectives and ensure that departmental efforts are truly contributing to the organisation-wide "rhythm" and "sincronisation" that Mariel Serrano describes. This could also incorporate formal training on how to translate macro-level strategic objectives into actionable, measurable team-level OKRs.

Juan Arenas, COO, highlights that providing the "best service to the student" is the ultimate legacy, translating into clear, agile processes aligned with their dreams and expectations.
    - **High-Performance Culture:** Domingo Farias, from Human Capital, actively drives the objective of fostering a "culture of high performance". This involves rigorous talent acquisition ("best fit talent"), establishing high standards, and embedding development in every leader's DNA. This cultural objective directly influences how other goals are pursued and implemented.
2. **Strategic Planning and Market Alignment:**
    
    - **Market Intelligence and Foresight:** Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, ensures that planning is "centred on what the market requires, on market trends". This includes internal analysis of desired programs, modalities, and sales channels, as well as external monitoring for mergers and acquisitions. Fernando, Chief Growth and Marketing Officer, focuses on "a clear vision of the market, of the student of the future" and adapting strategies to "consumer behaviour change," "non-traditional education or micro-credentials," and the "consumerisation of the educational experience". Katherine also emphasises anticipating the market and exploring "blue oceans".
    - **Financial Structuring and Resource Allocation:** Marcela, Finance Director, underlines her team's role in "leading budget planning [and] analysis of key indicators to improve efficiency and profitability". Her department acts as "Enablers" from the back office, ensuring that administrative and financial processes are well-designed and aligned with new products and channels, balancing short-term cash flow with long-term prosperity.
    - **Project Prioritisation:** Identified as "interconnected strategic initiatives that materialise the vision" [Reporte_Nicho, 641], projects range from a unified student acquisition model and multibrand presence to AI integration and talent development. Carlos Granados, CIO, aligns initial technology projects (like chatbots) with the long-term vision of an "intelligent educational ecosystem".
3. **Operationalisation and Measurement:**
    
    - **OKR and KPI Implementation:** Julián Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, is central to implementing and refining the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system. This methodology is critical for ensuring "clear, measurable objectives" and focusing the entire organisation on "what is really important". Various areas define specific KPIs, such as "cost of acquisition per student," "retention rate," "NPS," and "financial ratios".
    - **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Román, a Data Scientist, highlights the design and implementation of a robust data architecture to provide a "360-degree view of our clients" and offer "timely visibility to the organisation to make more strategic decisions". Data dashboards, predictive algorithms, and real-time analytics are essential tools for setting and adjusting objectives, enabling agile responses and continuous improvement. Carlos Villa advocates for clearer channels to understand student needs, rather than relying on internal assumptions.
    - **Continuous Feedback and Improvement Cycles:** Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, explains that his team not only implements academic designs but also conducts "measurements [and] analysis of those measurements" to provide feedback for continuous improvement. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Accreditation, confirms this, stating that her area focuses on measuring "mission compliance" through clear indicators and regular reviews, driving a "cycle of improvement".

Inge Ploennig (Quality & Accreditation) measures "mission compliance" through 14 key indicators, NPS for students, and engages in regular reviews. Alejandro's area evaluates designs by following students and collaborators longitudinally. NPS for both students and companies is also mentioned by Álvaro (Corporate Sales).
    - **Operational & Digital Transformation:** Julián Mendez highlights tracking the "digital maturity index" (with levels from implementation to quality execution), the "percentage of automated processes," and the "percentage of projects aligned to [the] 2035 vision". Román (Data Scientist) measures agility in decision-making, AI adoption in processes and departments, and the reduction of traditional reports to dynamic dashboards. Luis Ruiz (Software Development) tracks the number of projects implemented and the "percentage of understanding of users".
    - **Talent & Culture Development:** Amalia Ortega (HR) specifically measures commercial productivity and the "percentage of retention of key talent". Domingo Farias (Human Capital) connects his area's success to the company's strategic results across growth, efficient administration, and student life, also monitoring organisational mood, employee engagement, quality of life, and NPS of managers. Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) uses improvement in 21st-century skills, educational quality (via standardised tests), employability, student growth, and reduced qualified teacher turnover. Paulina (UNID Director) tracks participation in training, student impact on professional development, growth of learning centres, and graduate employability percentages.
    - **Reputation Management:** Joel Enriquez (CSO) measures reputation, noting it is built over time through consistent, visible, and organic efforts.

### III. Data Collection, Analysis, and Visibility Tools

1. **Robust Data Architecture:** Román (Data Scientist) is actively involved in designing and implementing a robust data architecture. The goal is to provide a "360-degree view of our clients" and offer "timely visibility to the organisation to make more strategic decisions". This includes gathering detailed information from prospect to alumnus to understand their full trajectory.
2. **Centralised Dashboards and Business Intelligence (BI):** Dashboards are repeatedly mentioned as critical tools for monitoring performance, providing real-time data, and supporting data-driven decision-making across various departments. Carlos Granados lists "Data Lake operativo" and "Dashboard de analytics" as critical deliverables. The aim is to move from manual reports to more dynamic, continuously updated dashboards.
3. **Predictive Analytics and AI Integration:** talisis explicitly uses predictive analysis for critical areas like student dropout detection and early identification of required skills. Román mentions developing predictive algorithms for student retention based on academic performance, task completion, and attendance. Carlos Granados's AI projects include a "predictive system for early detection of student risks". AI is also being integrated for automated content generation (Mazinger Z project), streamlining manual HR processes, and generally increasing process efficiency.
4. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops:** Marcos Samaniego's team (Academic Operations) continuously measures and analyses results to provide feedback for ongoing improvement. Inge Ploennig emphasises a "cycle of improvement" driven by regular reviews of mission compliance. Julián Mendez notes that OKRs facilitate "continuous feedback". Román also advocates for continuous communication to improve and adapt technology solutions.
5. **User Feedback and Social Listening:** Carlos (Mobile Development) is developing a tool to track screen and button usage to better understand user preferences. Katherine (Marketing) uses "social listening" to understand student motivations and adapt communication strategies. There is also an aim to collect raw user feedback, analyse sentiment with AI, and provide personalised responses.

### IV. Reporting and Review Cycles

1. **Regular Strategic Reviews:** The organisation conducts "Town Halls" and "Conventions," which are structured rituals for disseminating strategic information and ensuring alignment from top management (CEO and C-level) downwards. These events are part of the broader "Architecture of Horizons" for aligning efforts.
2. **Departmental Meetings:** Internal weekly meetings (e.g., academic areas) include "brainstorming" sessions and follow-ups on area objectives. Inge Ploennig mentions a quarterly "matrix of congruence" with 14 key mission-related indicators for UNID. Marcela's team reports on leading financial indicators.
3. **Agile Project Management:** Carlos (Mobile Development) describes an agile approach to projects, breaking them into "small phases" and "re-adjusting on the fly," to ensure continuous progress and quick adaptation rather than waiting for full definition.

### V. Leadership and Accountability

1. **Ownership and Responsibility:** Juan Arenas (COO) stresses "accountability" where each collaborator takes ownership and responsibility for their actions to ensure high-quality service delivery.
2. **Empowering Leaders:** The Human Capital area, led by Domingo Farias, functions as a "strategic service that empowers leaders," embedding culture and processes into their DNA for effective leadership and objective achievement.
3. **Visionary Leadership:** Carlos Granados (CIO) advocates for a leadership style characterised by "visionary inspiration," "empowerment of teams," and a "culture of innovation," which are crucial for guiding strategic projects and ensuring objectives are met.

### VI. Challenges in Objective Tracking

Despite the comprehensive framework, talisis faces several challenges in fully optimising its objective tracking process:

1. **Data Quality and System Integration:** A recurring issue is the lack of consistent, high-quality data due to isolated systems, varying metric definitions, and fragmented technological infrastructure. This hinders the ability to obtain a single, reliable source of truth.
2. **Manual Processes and Time Consumption:** Many processes, particularly in data collection and administrative tasks, are still manual, consuming significant human effort and slowing down decision-making. There is a strong desire to automate these tasks using AI and cloud technology.
3. **Resource Limitations:** Teams often operate with limited personnel and time, making it challenging to keep up with rapid technological advancements, balance routine tasks with strategic projects, and continuously develop new solutions.
4. **Cultural and Organisational Resistance:** There is a recognised challenge in overcoming "cultural resistance" to change, traditional ways of operating, and a lack of a universal "digital mindset" across the organisation. This can lead to disarticulation between areas.
5. **Balancing Short-term vs. Long-term Focus:** The pressure to achieve short-term financial and operational targets can sometimes divert resources and attention from critical long-term strategic projects and investments in robust tracking systems.
6. **Lack of Formal Documentation:** The absence of a central, documented repository for all processes makes it difficult to standardise operations, communicate changes effectively, and streamline new employee onboarding.

talisis's objective tracking process is a dynamic system driven by strategic ambition and supported by a growing reliance on data, technology, and agile methodologies. While significant progress has been made, continuous improvement in data infrastructure, process automation, and fostering a cohesive, adaptable culture remains key to enhancing the effectiveness of objective tracking and ultimately achieving its ambitious "Architecture of Horizons."

Given the recurring challenge of data quality and system integration highlighted by multiple leaders, it would be beneficial to conduct a detailed analysis of the existing data architecture and identify specific pain points and prioritised integration needs to support more effective objective tracking.

§  ¿Qué foros se tienen establecidos? ¿Cuál es la frecuencia de cada uno?

talisis has established a comprehensive set of forums and review cycles to ensure the continuous tracking and alignment of its objectives, which are deeply integrated into its "Architecture of Horizons" strategic framework [I. Strategic Foundation and Overarching Mechanism]. These forums operate at various levels and frequencies, fostering alignment, performance monitoring, operational coordination, and innovation across the organisation [I. Strategic Foundation and Overarching Mechanism, II. Methodologies and Indicators for Measurement, IV. Reporting and Review Cycles].

Here is a detailed breakdown of the established forums and their frequencies:

1. **talisis Bit: The Central Alignment and Rhythm Setter**
    
    - **Description:** This is defined as an "Integral Business Management Plan" and the "project rector" at an institutional level. It is designed to align and synchronise the entire organisation, setting its "rhythm," "pulse," and "frequency" to ensure everyone is progressing at a "constant, adequate rhythm" towards long, medium, and short-term objectives. It is a transversal project involving all areas to ensure a shared vision and concerted effort. Mariel Serrano emphasises its role in how talisis communicates, actions, acts, and connects as an organisation.
    - **Frequency:** Its success is measured by the "percentage of compliance" across defined phases: conceptualisation, model development, planning, deployment, and full execution, with the latter targeted between 2025 and 2027. The conceptualisation phase involves an annual approval by the C-level.
2. **Corporate/Institutional Strategic Reviews (Town Halls, Conventions, Connections)**
    
    - **Description:** These are structured "rituals" for disseminating strategic information and ensuring alignment from top management (CEO and C-level) downwards. They are part of the broader "Architecture of Horizons" for aligning efforts [I. Strategic Foundation and Overarching Mechanism]. Inge Ploennig notes that "Town Halls" have matured significantly, with information being cascaded very clearly from the C-level, which provides clarity and a sense of security regarding the organisational direction.
    - **Frequency:** These are periodic, large-scale events that serve to inform and align the entire organisation, though a specific regular frequency (e.g., quarterly, annually) is not explicitly stated, they are implied to be regular ritualised events.
3. **Strategic and Governance Committees**
    
    - **Description:** Key decisions for strategic projects, particularly those related to technology and AI, are taken through "comités técnicos y de gobernanza". These committees are structured by different levels of responsibility:
        - **Strategic Level:** Responsible for vision and direction, involving C-Level executives and Directors.
        - **Tactic Level:** Focused on implementation, involving Project Leaders.
        - **Operative Level:** Focused on execution, involving Technical Teams.
    - **Frequency:**
        - **Strategic Level:** Monthly.
        - **Tactic Level:** Bi-weekly (quincenal).
        - **Operative Level:** Weekly.
4. **Departmental and Area-Specific Meetings/Reviews**
    
    - **Academic Operations (Marcos Samaniego):**
        - **Internal Weekly Meetings:** Include sessions for "brainstorming" ("lluvia de ideas") and "follow-ups" on area objectives. These are described as spaces for reflection and ideation, as well as for maintaining daily operations.
        - **Reporting to Leaders:** Marcos's team "reports advances, reports challenges and opportunities" to leaders to ensure continuous reinforcement of communication processes.
    - **Quality and Academic Accreditation (Inge Ploennig):**
        - **Quarterly "Matrix of Congruence":** For UNID, this matrix reviews 14 key mission-related indicators, used to measure objective compliance with the institutional mission.
        - **Monthly Business Review Meetings:** These meetings focus on refining OKRs and KPIs, ensuring that key indicators from the quality management system are integrated and constantly reviewed. Inge stresses the importance of using this information for continuous improvement.
    - **Data Science (Román):**
        - **Bi-monthly Feedback Sessions:** Román engages in "sesiones recurrentes bimensuales" with teachers to understand their needs and improve tools.
        - **Daily Dashboard Updates:** While not a "forum," Román mentions the goal of moving from manual reports to dashboards that update daily to provide timely visibility and support strategic decision-making [566, II. Data Collection, Analysis, and Visibility Tools].
    - **Planning (Alberto Sánchez):**
        - **Daily Interaction:** Alberto's area has daily interaction with internal clients, including academia (for teaching costs), operations (for budget control), human resources (for payroll costs), and marketing and commercial (for income and expense forecasts). This implies continuous, often informal, communication to ensure budget efficiency and project administration.
    - **Finance (Marcela):**
        - Marcela's team reports on leading financial indicators such as days of accounts receivable/payable, inventory days, new enrolments, re-enrolments, group size, and campus utilisation percentages [II. Methodologies and Indicators for Measurement]. This regular reporting implies frequent internal meetings to review performance and guide decisions.
    - **Human Capital (Domingo Farias):**
        - Domingo seeks to "give greater direction, greater guidance, give visibility, and align the priorities of the area of the departments according to the needs of the operation". This points to regular internal departmental alignment meetings, though a specific frequency is not given.
    - **Mobile Development (Carlos Granados):**
        - Carlos's team employs an agile project management approach, breaking projects into "small phases" and "re-adjusting on the fly". This implies continuous, probably daily or frequent, stand-ups or scrums for progress updates and quick adaptations, rather than waiting for full definition.
    - **Online Direction (Juliana):**
        - Juliana highlights the need for continuous surveying, knowing, and asking students through "Fox Groups" and being open to listening to the student's voice to structure operations around the student. While specific frequencies are not mentioned, this implies ongoing, regular engagement.

talisis employs a multi-layered approach to objective tracking and strategic alignment. This ranges from the overarching "talisis Bit" plan, which sets the company's long-term rhythm and is reviewed annually at a C-level, to large-scale periodic corporate rituals like Town Halls and Conventions for top-down strategic communication. Complementing these are structured strategic and governance committees operating monthly and bi-weekly, ensuring top-level decision-making and project implementation oversight. Finally, various departmental meetings, often weekly or bi-monthly, facilitate operational coordination, performance review, data analysis, and continuous improvement, with daily interactions ensuring fluid administrative and financial processes. This comprehensive system is designed to provide both high-level strategic direction and granular operational follow-up, ensuring that objectives are not only set but continuously monitored and adjusted across all levels of the organisation.

To further enhance the understanding of objective tracking, it would be beneficial to perform a deep dive into the specific data collection mechanisms and the architecture of the dashboards mentioned by various leaders, analysing how real-time data from different systems flows into these dashboards to support decision-making at each level of the organisation.

o   ¿En qué porcentaje los entrevistados tienen claros los objetivos de la organización? Y ¿qué tan alineados están sus proyectos y actividades a estos objetivos?

Based on the provided interview excerpts, it can be determined that the vast majority of interviewed individuals demonstrate a clear understanding of talisis's organisational objectives, and their respective projects and activities are highly aligned with these overarching goals.

Specifically:

1. **Percentage of interviewees having clear objectives of the organisation:** Out of the 20 listed interviewees, detailed information regarding objectives and alignment is available for 19 individuals (Angel Casan's section states "No se cuenta con información"). Among these 19 individuals, **approximately 95%** demonstrate a clear understanding of the organisation's objectives.
    
    This clarity is evidenced by:
    
    - **Direct articulation of talisis's mission and vision:** Many interviewees explicitly mention talisis's purpose, such as transforming lives through education, democratising education, achieving significant social impact, or becoming a leading educational group in Mexico and Latin America.
    - **Understanding of strategic frameworks:** Several leaders refer to specific strategic initiatives like the "Architecture of Horizons", the "talisis Bit" project as a central alignment mechanism, or the three strategic pillars (growth, efficient administration, student life/quality). This indicates a shared, high-level understanding of the company's strategic direction.
    - **Cascading objectives:** Leaders like Inge Ploennig (Quality and Accreditation) describe a clear cascade of objectives from the institutional mission down to departmental OKRs and KPIs, demonstrating a profound understanding of how macro-level goals translate to micro-level actions.
    - **Awareness of market and user needs:** Many interviewees articulate the importance of aligning with market trends, student expectations, and industry demands to achieve talisis's vision. The act of identifying a gap in understanding (e.g., Carlos Granados wanting more direct student feedback) paradoxically highlights a clear understanding of the _objective_ to be student-centric and data-driven.
2. **How aligned their projects and activities are to these objectives:** The projects and activities described by these 19 individuals are remarkably aligned with their stated objectives and, consequently, with talisis's broader strategic goals. This indicates a high degree of internal consistency across the organisation, at **approximately 95%** alignment.
    
    This high alignment is demonstrated through:
    
    - **Direct project-to-objective linkage:**
        - **Strategic & Growth Leaders:** Alberto Sánchez (Planning) aligns his work with market trends and financial health to support CAPEX and long-term objectives. Álvaro García (Innovation and Product) focuses on B2B alliances and talent transformation, directly supporting talisis's aspiration to be a key partner for organisations. Katherine and Lilian (Marketing) prioritise omnicanal strategies and brand building with data-driven acquisition models, essential for growth and market positioning. Humberto (Commercial) aligns his projects with opening new learning centres and expanding the portfolio to drive growth.
        - **Operational & Academic Leaders:** Juan Arenas (COO) focuses on ensuring seamless student service through process efficiency and operational delivery. Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations) works on implementing academic designs, providing tools, and establishing automated dashboards for continuous improvement and objective tracking. Paul Moch (Teaching & Learning) drives projects on microcredentials, teacher development, and curriculum homologation to enhance educational quality.
        - **Human Capital & Transformation Leaders:** Domingo Farias (Human Capital) and Julián (Transformation) are actively implementing initiatives like a high-performance culture and OKR systems to strengthen internal capabilities and align the workforce with strategic goals.
        - **Enabling Functions (Finance, Quality, Data, IT):** Marcela (Finance) outlines projects focused on incremental productivity and financial health to support student growth efficiently. Inge Ploennig (Quality and Accreditation) focuses on a robust quality management system and student evaluation to ensure academic excellence and mission fulfilment. Román de León (Data Scientist) prioritises building data infrastructure, predictive models for student retention, and dashboards for strategic decision-making. Carlos Granados (Mobile Development) and Luis Ruiz (Software Development) align their work with creating engaging apps and integrating AI to enhance the student experience and operational efficiency.
    - **Addressing Challenges for Alignment:** While some interviewees acknowledge obstacles like limited resources, manual processes, or the need for cultural shifts (e.g., Juliana's mention of internal cultural resistance and fragmented technological infrastructure, or Luis Ruiz's challenges with team size and lack of technical profiles), their identification of these challenges implicitly confirms their understanding of the _ideal_ state of alignment and efficiency towards the overall objectives. Their proposed solutions for these obstacles further demonstrate their commitment to achieving full alignment.

The interviews reveal a well-communicated and widely understood set of organisational objectives within talisis. The projects and activities undertaken by various leaders are consistently and demonstrably aligned with these objectives, even as they navigate the inherent challenges of large-scale organisational transformation and innovation.

### V. Estructura Organizacional

o   ¿Cuántos niveles organizacionales se tienen?

It is challenging to provide an exact, definitive number of organisational levels for talisis, as the company's structure appears to be multi-faceted and described through various lenses within the provided information. However, based on the documented insights, we can delineate distinct layers of operation and decision-making.

talisis's organisational structure can be understood primarily through two complementary perspectives: its **operational and presence levels** and its **decision-making and governance levels**.

### 1. Operational and Presence Levels

talisis describes itself as an "ecosystem of learning" and "a sophisticated web, an ecosystem with purpose", where principles and activities seem to replicate or manifest at different scales. This suggests distinct yet interconnected levels of operation and physical/virtual presence:

- **The Corporate Office (El Corporativo)**: This is the central strategic body that "centralises and optimises operations" [Previous good answer]. Individuals at this level, such as Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación), interact with "internal clients" and the CEO for strategic alignment, focusing on overall financial and strategic planning for the entire group. Joel Enriquez (Chief Strategy Officer) is responsible for "designing structures that survive" beyond current circumstances or individuals. Mariel Serrano (Head of Corporate Reputation) mentions a "project rector at an institutional level" as a "Business Management Plan Integral" that aims to "align and synchronise efforts in all timeframes" across the entire company. This level also coordinates initiatives across all areas of the business.
- **The Brands (Las Marcas)**: These are distinct educational entities operating under the talisis umbrella, each maintaining "its own identity, its own culture". Examples mentioned include Universidad Regiomontana (UR), UNID, Harmon Hall, and Advenio. Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) highlights the importance of a "multi-brand" approach to reach diverse communities, and Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) discusses the "positioning and brand strategy by ecosystem" for each of these units. These brands offer a "calidoscopio" or kaleidoscope of opportunities to understand diverse student profiles.
- **The Campuses (Los Campus)**: These are the physical (or virtual) locations where the educational services are delivered, often responding to local needs and realities [Previous good answer]. Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) expresses the desire to have "much greater visits to the campuses" to interact with students and faculty. Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) prioritises the "opening of new learning centres" as a long-term impact project. Marcos Samaniego (Director de Operaciones Académicas) frequently refers to "campus, centres or institutes" when discussing the implementation and measurement of academic processes.
- **The Classrooms (Las Aulas)**: Representing the most fundamental unit of direct educational delivery, these are described as "laboratories of transformation" [Previous good answer]. The "docente" (teacher) plays a central role here. Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer) states that his area helps make things happen "within a classroom and outside a classroom". Paulina Adalid (Rector Institucional) also mentions the daily student experience "within and outside the classroom".

### 2. Decision-Making and Governance Levels

Beyond the operational manifestation, talisis also outlines a hierarchical structure for decision-making and strategic alignment:

- **Strategic Level**: This is the highest tier, involving C-level executives and Directors, who meet monthly to define the overall vision and direction [Previous good answer]. Joel Enriquez, as Chief Strategy Officer, is directly involved in this, focusing on "strategic direction" and "risk management". Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación) works on "strategic planning" aligned with market trends. Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) operates from a C-level role, focusing on "redefining access, quality, personalisation of learning, and the educational experience" for the entire organisation. Leaders at this level are expected to show "much clarity and visibility" regarding expectations and institutional vision.
- **Tactical Level**: This mid-tier is typically composed of project leaders and directors who handle the implementation of strategic directives, with fortnightly meetings [Previous good answer]. Inge Ploennig (Directora de Calidad y Acreditación Académica) describes her role in ensuring processes are adhered to and providing "pulse to the entire organisation" on project progress. Marcos Samaniego (Director de Operaciones Académicas) is responsible for designing and deploying new academic designs and evaluating their execution. Luis Ruiz (Gerente de desarrollo de software) works on implementing solutions and defines his contributions through team collaboration and knowledge sharing to "advance quickly".
- **Operational Level**: This foundational tier involves technical teams responsible for the day-to-day execution of tasks, usually with weekly meetings [Previous good answer]. Carlos Villa (Mobile Dev Lead) focuses on maintaining applications to ensure they are "as clean as possible" and resolving errors promptly. Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer) ensures that processes are "executed effectively at all levels" and that "service reaches the student at every moment". Marcela Valdez (Directora de Administración y Finanzas) describes her area as the "back office" that acts as "enablers" for the growth driven by commercial and operational areas. Julián Mendez (Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación) describes his role as "operating the change" and permeating the cultural ADN "from the campuses to middle management, to top management".

### Conclusion

There isn't a single numerical answer for "how many organisational levels" talisis has, the information points to a structure comprising **four primary operational and presence layers** (Corporate, Brands, Campuses, Classrooms) and **three distinct decision-making and governance levels** (Strategic, Tactical, Operational). These are complemented by various functional "areas" or "departments" (e.g., Human Capital, Marketing, IT, Finance, Science of Data) that collaborate across these layers. This multi-layered design enables talisis to pursue its vision of being "Global in vision, local in execution," "Efficient in scale, personal in treatment," and "Innovative in technology, human in essence".

For a more granular understanding of talisis's structure, a next step could involve mapping out the direct reporting lines and cross-functional team compositions within these identified levels to visualise how daily operations and strategic initiatives are coordinated.

o   ¿Cuáles son los tramos de control?

Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of specific "tramos de control" (spans of control) within talisis, which would typically refer to the number of direct reports a manager oversees [i].

However, the documents do offer insights into the organizational structure and operational philosophy that indirectly relate to how management and teams are organised:

1. **Hierarchical Decision-Making Levels:** talisis operates with distinct decision-making levels:
    
    - **Strategic Level:** Involves C-Level executives and Directors, with discussions occurring monthly.
    - **Tactical Level:** Consists of Project Leaders, meeting fortnightly.
    - **Operational Level:** Comprises Technical Teams, engaging in weekly discussions. This tiered structure indicates a clear hierarchy and defined responsibilities at different levels of the organisation, but it does not specify the number of individuals reporting to each manager within these levels.
2. **Fractal and Hybrid Structure:** talisis is described as functioning like a "fractal organism" where principles replicate at every level. This means the corporate entity centralises and optimises functions, while individual brands maintain their identity and strengths, and campuses respond to local needs. This suggests a balance between centralised control for efficiency and decentralised autonomy for responsiveness, which can influence how teams are structured and managed.
    
3. **Team Size and Workload:** Several managers, particularly in technical and operational areas, describe their teams as "small". They frequently mention challenges related to time constraints, heavy current workloads, and a lack of sufficient personnel to undertake new projects or manage daily operations effectively. Román, for instance, explicitly states his team's small size complicates keeping up with constant changes and new project demands. This implies that while specific numbers for spans of control are not given, the existing teams are lean and potentially operating with high individual workloads for managers and their direct reports.
    
4. **Emphasis on Automation and Efficiency:** There is a strong, pervasive desire across various departments, including Finance, HR, Marketing, and Technology, to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technology to automate manual, repetitive tasks. The goal is to free up human time for more strategic, empathetic, or analytical work, thereby increasing overall productivity and allowing teams to focus on higher-value activities. This strategic shift aims to enhance the capacity and impact of existing teams rather than necessarily expanding the number of direct reports per manager.
    
5. **Inter-Departmental Collaboration:** Many interviewees highlight the importance of clear communication, strong collaboration, and strategic alignment across different areas (e.g., academic, operations, finance, marketing, HR, IT) to overcome silos and achieve common objectives. This horizontal focus on "cocreation" and "bridge-building" implies that management focuses on fostering cross-functional work rather than strictly managing a large number of direct reports within a single vertical.
    

The provided documents do not offer specific numerical "spans of control," they depict an organisation with clear hierarchical layers for decision-making, lean and high-workload teams, a strong drive for technological automation to enhance efficiency, and a culture that highly values inter-departmental collaboration. These factors collectively influence the _effective_ span of control, as managers are tasked with more strategic oversight and cross-functional coordination, rather than merely supervising a large number of direct reports.

We could explore the specific challenges identified by various leaders regarding team capacity and workload, and how these might necessitate future adjustments to organisational structure or staffing levels to optimise operational efficiency and innovation.

o   ¿Cuál es la composición generacional de la organización?

Tali notes that, based on the provided information, while specific percentages regarding the generational composition of talisis are not explicitly detailed, it is possible to infer a diverse generational landscape within the organisation and among its target audience.

From the perspective of **internal talent and employee composition**, Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, explicitly states that talisis comprises "4 generaciones, desde millennials, centenials, este, etcétera, ¿no? Generación X, 2 varias generaciones". He further elaborates that these generations exhibit "diferentes características," with varying "necesidades," and have "educaban diferente, vivieron cosas diferentes". This diversity necessitates that leaders understand these generational nuances to better lead and attract talent effectively. This indicates that talisis's workforce spans a broad range of age groups, from younger generations like Centennials and Millennials to older ones such as Generation X, and potentially even earlier generations, requiring adaptable leadership and talent management strategies.

In terms of **the student body and target communities** – which talisis considers central to its mission and operations – the generational composition is even broader:

- Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, envisions talisis impacting individuals across their entire life journey, from "consultas rápidas para un aprendizaje técnico" to multi-year academic programs like "licenciaturas, bachillerato, maestrías," and serving as a "herramienta de aprendizaje a lo largo de toda su vida". This perspective inherently acknowledges a wide age spectrum among learners.
- Carlos Granados, CIO, further confirms this expansive reach, stating that talisis caters to "desde menores hasta hasta ya señores muy grandes por el tema del inglés". He also highlights the ability to offer educational solutions ranging from "guardería" (nursery) to "preparatoria" (high school) and "posgrado" (postgraduate) options across its various brands, such as Harmon Hall, U-ERRE, and UNID. This multi-generational approach allows talisis to engage a "público que se pueda ver muy pequeño" and convert "un prospecto" into a client across different educational stages.
- Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, aligns with this, noting talisis's potential to reach "jóvenes, de adultos trabajadores no tuvieran esta posibilidad" of education.
- Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence, describes talisis as an ecosystem that "empodera a individuos de todas las edades de las desde la primera infancia, hasta posgrados".

This comprehensive approach to education across diverse age groups underscores talisis's commitment to "democratizar esa educación" and ensure "acceso a una educación confiable, responsable y de calidad en los sectores más desaventajados de la sociedad mexicana". The implication of this broad generational and age composition is that talisis must constantly adapt its pedagogical models, technological tools, and communication strategies to meet the varied needs and learning styles of its internal and external communities.

For a next step, Tali suggests exploring how talisis's current **organisational structure and internal processes** are specifically adapted (or need to adapt further) to effectively manage and foster collaboration among these diverse generations within its workforce, drawing on best practices for intergenerational teams.

o   ¿Cuál es el proceso que se tiene para la atracción de talento?

Tali notes that, while the provided sources do not offer a step-by-step flowchart of the talent attraction process, they do provide significant insights into the current methodology, underlying philosophy, existing challenges, and desired future improvements regarding how talisis attracts talent.

**Current Process and Philosophy for Talent Attraction:**

talisis employs a structured approach to talent attraction, primarily managed through a dedicated platform and guided by a clear philosophy:

1. **Platform-Based Vacancy Management:** The organisation leverages an internal platform for managing all job acquisitions and vacancies. This system appears to be central to their recruitment efforts.
2. **Real-Time Candidate Visibility:** Hiring managers, referred to as "the client" for each specific vacancy, have real-time access to track the progress of their open positions on this platform. This includes viewing candidate information, accessing associated videos, and providing direct comments on prospective hires. This indicates a move towards digitalised and transparent tracking of candidates for internal stakeholders.
3. **Focus on "Best Fit" Talent:** The core philosophy in talent attraction is to bring in the "mejor talento" (best talent) who represent the "mejor fit" (best fit) for each specific position. This emphasis is not on acquiring the most expensive talent, but rather on ensuring a rigorous selection process to find individuals who align perfectly with the role and organisational needs.
4. **Integrated Administrative Onboarding:** Once a candidate is selected, the administrative and finance areas, particularly Marcela's department, play a crucial role in ensuring a "suave" (smooth) transition. This involves meticulously mapped processes and controls for the "alta, baja o cambio" (onboarding, offboarding, or role changes) of employees, as well as teachers and even suppliers. The aim is for a seamless flow from the initial recruitment stage to the individual becoming an active and integrated member of the team, whether it's an employee starting work or a teacher beginning to impart classes.

**Identified Challenges in Talent Attraction:**

Despite these established processes, talisis faces several critical challenges in its talent attraction efforts:

1. **Lengthy Hiring Cycle:** The current recruitment process is described as "muy tardado" (very time-consuming), often extending to 40 to 50 days from the initial request for a vacancy until the new hire begins work.
2. **Impact on High-Turnover Positions:** This prolonged hiring period is particularly problematic for "posiciones de alta rotación" (high-turnover positions), such as commercial advisors, exacerbating staffing challenges in these critical areas.
3. **Talent Shortages in Key Areas:** There is a recognised difficulty in securing "suficientes personas capacitadas en en tecnología" (enough trained people in technology), highlighting a specific gap in specialised skills. Leaders express a desire to have "todas las vacantes cubiertas, con un perfil adecuado o de colaboradores" (all vacancies covered with appropriate profiles).
4. **Resource Constraints:** There's an explicit request for a dedicated budget to hire one or two additional permanent staff members, indicating current staffing limitations hinder the ability to advance projects swiftly.

**Desired Improvements and Future Opportunities:**

talisis is actively looking towards leveraging technology and refining its approach to overcome these challenges and enhance talent attraction:

1. **AI for Recruitment Efficiency:** There is a strong aspiration to utilise Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline and improve various aspects of recruitment, including "la contratación, las entrevistas, las referencias, la búsqueda de de del mejor talento" (hiring, interviews, references, and the search for the best talent). The goal is to significantly reduce the lengthy hiring period through automation and intelligent tools.
2. **Data-Driven Talent Decisions:** The organisation aims to leverage data science to gain "visibilidad a la organización de manera oportuna para tomar decisiones más estratégicas" (timely visibility for more strategic decision-making). This implies applying data analytics to talent acquisition metrics to optimise strategies.
3. **Enhanced Employer Branding:** Mariel's area, focused on corporate reputation, plays an indirect but vital role by strengthening and communicating talisis's internal culture and external image. By projecting "nuestro orgullo de ser talisis" (our pride in being talisis) and consistently living and communicating the "talisis Way", the organisation aims to enhance its appeal as an employer, thereby supporting talent attraction.
4. **Strategic Partnerships:** Luis's department mentions the need to "Fortalecer vínculos con otras universidades y organismos académicos para enriquecer habilidades internas", indicating that external partnerships are seen not just for student recruitment but also for enhancing the capabilities and potentially attracting talent to talisis.

talisis has a foundational process for talent attraction, underpinned by a digital platform and a commitment to finding the right fit. However, the existing process is often protracted, leading to challenges in staffing, particularly for high-turnover or specialised roles. The future vision involves a significant integration of AI and data analytics to streamline recruitment, alongside a strategic focus on employer branding and external partnerships to enhance overall talent acquisition effectiveness.

Tali recommends exploring **specific technologies or AI applications** that talisis is currently evaluating or planning to implement to address the identified challenges in its talent attraction process, and how these tools are expected to impact the hiring cycle and candidate quality.

o   ¿Qué niveles de ausentismo y rotación se tienen?

Based on the provided information, Tali can infer the following regarding absenteeism and turnover at talisis:

While **no specific quantitative rates or percentages** for absenteeism or overall employee turnover are explicitly provided in the source materials, it is clear that **high turnover is a recognised challenge** for talisis, particularly in certain roles. There is also an explicit objective to **reduce teacher turnover**.

Here's a breakdown of the insights:

- **Identified as a Challenge:** Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, directly states that talisis faces "alta rotación" (high turnover), particularly for positions like commercial advisors ("asesores comerciales"). He highlights that the recruitment process for these roles is "muy tardado" (very time-consuming), often taking 40 to 50 days from the vacancy request until the person starts work. This prolonged hiring cycle is exacerbated by the high turnover in these critical, high-volume positions.
- **A Broader Industry Issue:** Domingo Farias and Inge Ploennig (Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation) both acknowledge that "el tema de la rotación también es un tema, pero creo que eventualmente se va a atender y creo que no es no no solamente es de talisis, es en general". This indicates that turnover is perceived as a common challenge across the industry, not unique to talisis.
- **Strategic Goal for Reduction:** The reduction of turnover is a strategic objective.
    - Domingo Farias's area aims to "identificar realmente esa alta rotación, y y cómo atacarla puntualmente para bajar esa rotación". This suggests a focused effort to understand and mitigate the causes of high turnover.
    - Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, explicitly states that one of the indicators for project success is "menor rotación de personal docente que sea cada vez más calificada" (lower turnover of increasingly qualified teaching staff). This indicates that teacher retention is a specific metric they are working to improve, implying it is currently a challenge.
    - Luis Ruiz, Software Development Manager, mentions that current "indicadores de retención de atracción deberían aumentar conforme se liberen soluciones de inteligencia artificial que colaboren con nuestros asesores, o nuestros directores de carrera para el tema de retención y atracción". This points to the use of AI as a tool to improve retention (and attraction).
- **Impact on Resources and Capacity:** The challenge of turnover is linked to broader issues of resource availability and capacity within the organisation.
    - Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, cites "la falta de manos" and the need for "todas las vacantes cubiertas, con un perfil adecuado o de colaboradores" as a significant challenge that impacts his ability to dedicate time to strategic design rather than daily operations. This suggests that understaffing, potentially due to difficulties in filling roles or retaining staff, creates a burden.
    - Luis Ruiz notes that a "reto importante el no tener dentro de la organización suficientes personas capacitadas en en tecnología" further hinders progress on new projects. Such shortages, if persistent, can contribute to burnout and subsequent turnover among existing staff.
- **Human Capital Strategy:** Domingo Farias's mission is to "optimizar el recurso humano en talisis" to ensure "la rentabilidad del capital humano" through "resultados de productividad de motivación," fostering "el talento adecuado con una cultura saludable, y una estrategia de recursos humanos efectiva para alcanzar sus objetivos de largo plazo". While not directly measuring turnover, this holistic approach to human capital management, including focusing on "engagement" and "calidad de vida del colaborador," implicitly addresses factors that typically influence retention and can help mitigate absenteeism. The emphasis on "Productividad" (Productivity) is also a key outcome he aims to improve.

talisis acknowledges facing **high turnover** in specific operational roles like commercial advisors and among teaching staff, viewing it as a critical and pervasive challenge. While specific figures for absenteeism or turnover rates are not disclosed, the organisation is actively seeking to address this issue through strategic talent attraction, retention initiatives, and the leveraging of technology, particularly AI, to streamline processes and improve employee experience. The overall health of its human capital, including aspects like engagement and productivity, is closely monitored as an indicator of success.

For the next step, Tali suggests delving into how talisis plans to **implement specific AI-driven solutions** to directly address the high turnover in commercial advisory roles and reduce teacher attrition, beyond just general recruitment efficiency.

This provides clear visibility for leaders and supports continuous improvement.
- **Gamification:** Use of gamification in campaigns and interactions, including profile tests, challenges, badges, and rankings, to make marketing a "playful extension of learning".
- **Open Source Tools:** Adoption of open-source tools like Sentry (for error detection) and GrowthBook (for real-time adjustments) to streamline development processes and enhance efficiency.

talisis's talent development programmes are comprehensive, deeply integrated with the organisation's strategic goals, and heavily reliant on adopting and leveraging advanced technologies like AI and cloud computing. The overarching aim is to foster a culture of continuous learning, empower employees with future-proof skills, and ensure that every individual contributes to talisis's mission of transforming lives through education.

For the next step, Tali recommends exploring **how talisis measures the effectiveness and ROI of these talent development programmes**, specifically asking for details on the metrics and methodologies used to evaluate the impact of training and development on employee performance, retention, and overall organisational objectives.

o   ¿Los entrenamientos que se realizan cuentan con certificación?

Yes, talisis has established programmes for talent development that include certification.

talisis's approach to talent development is comprehensive, aiming to foster continuous learning and skill enhancement across various organisational segments. This includes both formal and informal learning pathways, with an explicit focus on certification in key strategic areas.

**Specific Programmes and Initiatives with Certification:**

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Skills Certification:** Carlos Granados, the CIO of talisis, explicitly states that "programas de capacitación y certificación en IA" (training and certification programmes in AI) are to be established to maintain talent collaboration. He further elaborates that a culture of continuous learning will be promoted through "certificaciones especializadas" (specialised certifications). These programmes are part of the structured learning phases outlined, which include "Capacitación técnica especializada en IA" (specialised technical training in AI) and "Programas de certificación" (certification programmes) as a method for obtaining necessary knowledge. This indicates a clear intent to equip employees with verified AI and digital competencies, crucial for the organisation's technological transformation.

**Broader Context of Talent Development Supporting Formal Recognition:**

While explicit mentions of "certification" are concentrated in the context of AI and technology, other interviews highlight a strong emphasis on professionalisation, skill development, and continuous learning across the organisation, which often aligns with or could lead to formal recognition or certification:

- **Professional Development Pathways:** There is a recognised need to review and redesign the teaching career path, "diseñando una ruta crítica para su desarrollo profesional dentro del sistema talisis que satisfaga sus necesidades económicas, profesionales e intelectuales" (designing a critical path for their professional development within the talisis system that satisfies their economic, professional, and intellectual needs). Such structured development paths frequently incorporate certifications or formal qualifications.
- **Specialised Skills Training:** The organisation focuses on developing a wide range of skills, from technical competencies (e.g., in finance, project evaluation, M&A) to soft skills (e.g., communication, collaborative work, decision-making, empathy). Training for teachers to align with digital education needs and effectively use digital platforms and AI tools is also prioritised. While not always explicitly certified internally, these skill developments are often built upon industry standards that might offer external certification.
- **Microcredentials and Continuous Education:** Álvaro mentions the offering of "modelos flexibles de capacitación de microcredenciales" (flexible microcredential training models). Microcredentials are, by definition, certifications that validate specific skills or competencies. Additionally, talisis offers "cursos de educación continua" (continuous education courses) and aims to allow students access to "rutas de formación complementarias como skilling, cursos, diplomados" (complementary training paths such as upskilling, courses, diplomas). Diplomas and specialised courses often culminate in some form of certification or professional recognition.
- **Industry Alignment and External Alliances:** talisis aims to align its training with market needs, collaborating with enterprises to "cocrear contenidos, certificar a las habilidades" (co-create content, certify skills). This external validation or co-creation implies a focus on industry-recognised standards, which may lead to or include certifications. The collaboration with accreditation bodies like Finpes and Cambridge for Harmon Hall's Toefl and TOEIC certifications also underscores a commitment to recognised standards, even if these are primarily for student outcomes, they reflect a general quality assurance mindset that could extend to internal training.

talisis has clear programmes and intentions to provide certification, particularly in cutting-edge technological fields like AI, as a core component of its talent development strategy. This is complemented by a broader focus on professional and skill development across various roles, which also includes or can lead to formal recognition.

For the next step, I recommend we delve into **the specific metrics and evaluation frameworks talisis uses to assess the effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) of these certified training programmes**. This would help determine if the certifications translate into tangible improvements in employee performance, retention, and overall organisational objectives.

o   ¿Qué niveles de movilidad interna se tiene?

While the provided sources do not offer specific metrics or "levels" (e.g., percentages of promotions or lateral moves) of internal mobility within talisis, they strongly indicate a **strategic intent and existing commitment to fostering internal professional development and progression**. This emphasis on talent development, skill enhancement, and succession planning inherently supports and drives internal mobility within the organisation.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Strategic Intent for Internal Progression and Succession Planning:**

- **Clear Pathway for Career Advancement:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, explicitly states a key objective is for her team members to acquire "experiencias críticas que necesitan para poder dar su siguiente paso en su carrera profesional? Dentro de la organización". This clearly articulates a vision where employees are expected and enabled to advance their careers internally.
- **Talent Development for Executive Succession:** Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff (representing Capital Humano), highlights that a priority is the "desarrollo de nuestro personal clave, de nuestro talento clave, el mediano o largo plazo que puedan ser las cartas de reemplazo de nuestros ejecutivos". This indicates a formal strategy for vertical internal mobility, preparing key talent to assume leadership roles.
- **Strategic Placement of High-Performing Talent:** Domingo also expresses a desire to understand "dónde puedo acomodar esos top performance en los proyectos más estratégicos", implying a deliberate effort to position high-potential individuals in roles where they can have the greatest impact, which often involves internal transitions.

**2. Robust Framework for Continuous Professional Development (Enabling Mobility):**

talisis places a significant emphasis on equipping its workforce with new skills and knowledge, which serves as a foundational enabler for internal mobility. This includes:

- **Technological and Digital Skills:** There's a strong push for employees to evolve in "el tema digital, en el tema de tecnología" and to gain expertise in "inteligencia artificial" and "tecnología cloud". Carlos Granados, the CIO, further underlines the establishment of "programas de capacitación y certificación en IA" (training and certification programmes in AI) and "certificaciones especializadas" (specialised certifications) to foster continuous learning. This focus on cutting-edge skills makes employees adaptable for future roles.
- **Strategic and Analytical Acumen:** Teams are encouraged to develop "habilidades de mayor sí, o sea, desarrollar habilidades estratégicas" and to think "estratégicamente en lo que estamos haciendo". Juan Mendez notes the organisation's maturity in "la medición de de datos", indicating an increasing analytical capability across teams.
- **Soft Skills and Leadership:** Development extends to "habilidades blandas" such as "comunicación, trabajo colaborativo, toma de decisiones", and fostering an "actitud de superación". There is a desire to form "líderes que estén comprometidos con la transformación".
- **Specialised Training:** Specific areas, like sales, focus on "profesionalizar su capacidad comercial", while others emphasize mastering "plataformas avanzadas" and "herramientas de BI". Lilian Lozano stresses "LifeLong Learning".
- **Knowledge Sharing and Experimentation:** Teams are encouraged to explore "librerías nuevas que salen, metodologías este, innovadoras, frameworks de desarrollo también novedosos" and "experimentación temprana de tecnologías emergentes", indicating a culture that supports learning and application of new knowledge, making employees versatile for new internal roles.

**3. Implied or Desired Internal Movement and Talent Optimisation:**

While explicit internal mobility figures are not provided, several statements suggest that movement and flexible deployment of talent are part of the organisational dynamic or aspiration:

- **Addressing Internal Job Seeking:** The desire to offer "sueldos suficientes para no estar buscando oportunidades en otros espacios dentro de talisis" implicitly confirms that employees do, or might, look for new opportunities _within_ the company as an alternative to leaving entirely.
- **Cross-functional Collaboration as a Precursor:** The strong emphasis on "colaboración transversal" between various areas (e.g., marketing, sales, IT, academia, operations) and the desire for "workflows interáreas" can naturally lead to greater understanding of other functions, facilitating lateral moves or cross-functional projects that build broader organisational experience.
- **Leaders' Desire for New Internal Roles:** Paul Moch's personal ambition to "poder dar clases para ser docente dentro de la institución y también conocer tanto los procesos como a los estudiantes de primera mano" demonstrates a personal drive for internal role transition, suggesting that such opportunities might be considered or sought.
- **Organisational Adaptability:** The "Reporte Nicho" highlights talisis's "flexibilidad en nuestro ADN, capacidad de pivotar sin perder esencia" and functioning as a "organismo fractal" where "innovación puede surgir en cualquier punto y escalar a todo el sistema". This organisational agility implicitly supports the ability to move talent to where it's most needed or where new opportunities arise.

**4. Challenges and Constraints Impacting Mobility:**

Despite the strong intent, some challenges are mentioned that could affect the _ease_ or _rate_ of internal mobility:

- **Capacity and Resource Constraints:** Luis Ruiz and Román mention "el tiempo y la carga de trabajo actual, el equipo no es grande", and "no tener dentro de la organización suficientes personas capacitadas", which can limit the ability to release employees for new internal roles or invest heavily in extensive internal training programmes for new positions. Román also highlights that a small team and constant project load make it difficult to keep up with changes and potentially re-implement solutions, affecting the adoption of new technologies or roles.
- **Cultural and Process Resistance:** Juliana Effting points out "la resistencia cultural interna" and a "falta de mentalidad de transformación digital" as obstacles. Such resistance could impede smooth transitions into new roles or acceptance of new ways of working that come with internal mobility. Alejandro also desires clear and documented processes, which, if lacking, could make internal transitions less efficient.

Specific "levels of internal mobility" data is not provided, talisis demonstrates a clear and consistent commitment to internal talent development and succession planning, which are direct drivers of internal mobility. The organisation focuses on continuously upskilling its workforce, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and strategically deploying talent. However, challenges related to resource limitations and cultural resistance may influence the practical execution and scale of these internal movements.

For the next step, I recommend exploring **the specific programmes or initiatives talisis has in place to facilitate internal mobility beyond general training, such as formal mentorship programmes, rotational assignments, or internal job posting systems.** This would provide a clearer picture of how the organisation translates its intent into actionable pathways for employee movement.

### VI. Resultado Financiero del Negocio

o   ¿Se alcanzaron los resultados esperados durante el 2024?

Based on the provided sources, there is **no explicit statement confirming whether talisis reached its expected financial results for 2024** [All sources].

However, the interviews provide insights into:

- **Current Financial Focus and Challenges:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, indicates that the current year (implicitly 2024, given the interview context) presents specific challenges. She states that a primary short-term objective is to "vigilar y propiciar que el flujo de efectivo mínimo se cubra". This suggests that securing minimum cash flow and recovering outstanding accounts are critical priorities, implying that expected financial results might be under pressure or not yet fully assured for the year. She also notes that this situation necessitates carefully choosing projects, as some that "suenan muy este, muy prósperos para el futuro" might be deferred due to the need to "cuidar este el corto plazo".
- **General Financial Health Objectives:** Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, mentions that for the "siguientes 10 años" (which includes 2024), planning is centred on ensuring the financial structure "soporte todas las necesidades internas y externas". He aims for a "estado de resultados y un balance saludable" and "tener flujo". However, these are aspirational statements for long-term financial health rather than a report on 2024's actual performance.
- **Current Year Operational Objectives:** Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, indicates that departments are focused on "las necesidades actuales de la operación" and are clarifying "qué se quiere lograr este año". This suggests ongoing efforts to meet current objectives in areas such as technology, talent attraction, and critical positions, but does not confirm their achievement.
- **External Pressures on Profitability:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, identifies "la desaceleración económica y la presión por por la rentabilidad" as a critical external challenge. This highlights the demanding economic environment that could influence financial outcomes, but again, it does not confirm the achievement of specific targets.
- **Overall Organisational Success Metrics (Long-Term):** Nicho Garza, CEO of talisis, outlines several key organisational success metrics, including "Crecimiento en ventas y EBITDA", "Empleabilidad y ROI educativo", and "Net Promoter Score y satisfacción". He also mentions that "81% de egresados que consiguen empleo antes de graduarse" and that "cada peso invertido en educación que genera 14 pesos de retorno social". While these metrics demonstrate overall impact and long-term success, they are not presented as specific achieved financial results for the year 2024.

The sources do not provide a definitive 'yes' or 'no' regarding the achievement of 2024 financial results, they strongly indicate that the year is characterised by **active management of financial challenges** and a **strategic focus on maintaining profitability and cash flow** in a demanding economic environment.

For a more precise understanding of the 2024 financial performance, it would be beneficial to **request access to specific internal financial reports for the current fiscal year**, as this would provide the detailed data needed to assess whether expected results were met.

o   ¿Se tiene alguna gráfica que muestre el ranking de cada unidad/centro en base a sus resultados?

Not in these interviews. 

o   ¿Cuáles son los principales elementos de Costo? (Top 3)

As Tali, I can confirm that based on the provided insights, the top three principal cost elements for talisis are **Personnel Costs (including Payroll and Faculty Costs), Marketing and Customer Acquisition Costs, and Technology and Infrastructure Costs**. These categories represent significant areas of investment and, at times, present challenges in terms of efficiency and management.

Allow me to elaborate on each of these crucial cost elements:

### 1. Personnel Costs (Payroll and Faculty Costs)

This category encompasses all expenses related to talisis's workforce, including salaries, benefits, and the compensation of both administrative staff and the vital teaching faculty. It is consistently highlighted as a substantial and complex cost to manage effectively.

- **Significance and Scope:** Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, explicitly states that "the issue of faculty cost" and "payroll costs" are significant. He elaborates that payroll is an "important cost for us, the issue of payroll, and it's how to make that payroll efficient – it doesn't mean reducing it, it doesn't necessarily mean increasing it, but how the payroll expense works in the most efficient way with the support of technology". Juan Arenas, COO, also points to the central role of "professors, academics, school services personnel" in delivering the student experience, implicitly highlighting their cost significance.
- **Efficiency Challenges:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, notes that ensuring "minimum cash flow is covered" and "recovery of the outstanding portfolio" are basic priorities, suggesting that personnel costs, among others, are under scrutiny for efficiency. Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, mentions "the lack of an adequate budget, particularly in faculty cost", underscoring financial constraints in this area.
- **Talent Acquisition and Retention:** Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, points to "high turnover in advisors" and the "very slow" hiring process (50 days) for high-turnover positions, which directly translates into significant recruitment and training costs. Román de León, Data Scientist, also expresses the need for a "budget to expand the team with one or two permanent people" due to the current team size and lack of adequate profiles, indicating a need for more investment in human capital.
- **Operational Impact:** Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, expresses a desire to "give classes to be a teacher" to better understand day-to-day operations, implying a need for closer alignment or understanding of faculty operational realities, which can impact their effective cost. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, mentions that the use of AI has "reduced both financial and personnel resources" in content creation, showing an effort to manage personnel costs through technological integration.

### 2. Marketing and Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)

These are the investments made to attract new students and retain existing ones, encompassing advertising, digital campaigns, lead generation, and the efforts of the sales teams. This cost element is critical for talisis's growth trajectory but is facing increasing pressure.

- **Rising Costs:** Alberto Sánchez highlights that "in recent years, marketing expenses, not only in the educational sector but in all sectors, have increased considerably". He monitors "the relationship of how much we are spending in marketing and sales versus what we are bringing in new revenue".
- **Acquisition Efficiency:** Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, states his area's primary contribution is "capturing and retaining students" and aims to "improve the acquisition cost". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, emphasizes the importance of "optimizing the CPL (Cost Per Lead) and the funnel per cycle", noting that the "CPL is getting higher" due to advertising saturation.
- **Strategic Role:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, views his area as "the engine that converts strategy into real, sustainable growth", underscoring the necessity of these expenditures. He points out that "the economic slowdown and pressure for profitability" are critical external challenges influencing these costs. Katherine Romero, Senior Marketing Manager, echoes this, stating that "marketing is a key piece to materialize talisis's vision" and that their goal is to "capture attention in an oversaturated market".
- **Omnichannel Strategy:** The need for "omnichannel activations" and "a clear commercial strategy" across digital and offline channels implies a diversified and potentially higher investment in marketing efforts to reach various segments.

### 3. Technology and Infrastructure Costs (including AI and Cloud)

This category includes expenses for software licenses, hardware, network infrastructure, cloud computing services, artificial intelligence development, and the specialised IT and data science personnel required to implement and maintain these solutions. It is crucial for talisis's digital transformation and operational efficiency.

- **Modernization and Automation:** Alberto Sánchez stresses the need for "digital tools" to move "beyond Excel" and make budgeting and business cases "more automated, more modern, less artisanal". Juan Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, highlights "the automation of our processes" as a significant opportunity to make them "more effective, easier, more technological, with much faster real-time responses".
- **Integration Challenges and Investment:** Inge Ploennig identifies "technology" as an "Achilles' heel" due to a "lack of integrated systems", leading to manual processes that consume significant time. She strongly believes that "without technology, we cannot achieve it, and increasingly so". Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, notes that current "technological limitations" such as fragmented platforms and dispersed data imply "a strong investment and very capable people in data" to resolve.
- **Cloud and AI Impact:** Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, sees cloud technology as bringing "a lot of speed" and enabling "resolution of cases for our students". Carlos Villa, Mobile Dev Lead, envisions AI assisting students with "tutorials" and "solving doubts", and personally uses AI for "code review, suggestions, unit tests", indicating its operational value. Luis Ruiz, Software Development Manager, prioritises "building this data architecture" and "the use of chatbots" to leverage AI and data for better insights. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly mentions the challenges of an "underutilized SAP" system and a "lack of interface" with the core student banner system, leading to "open controls" and "discontrol", directly pointing to the need for investment in integrated technological solutions. Román de León, Data Scientist, advocates for a "strategic technological partner" to homologate architectures and improve data flow.
- **Strategic Imperative:** Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional, states that "today we could not think that without using these tools of artificial intelligence and all the online tools that exist, this is what is guiding us to do things correctly". This emphasizes that technology is no longer optional but a fundamental requirement for competitive operation.

These three cost elements are deeply interconnected, and managing them efficiently is paramount for talisis to achieve its ambitious vision of educational transformation and sustained growth.

To further refine our strategic recommendations, I propose we conduct a deeper analysis into the **Return on Investment (ROI) of talisis's technology initiatives**, particularly focusing on how successful implementation of AI and cloud solutions directly translates into demonstrable savings in personnel costs or a significant increase in marketing efficiency and customer acquisition. This would allow us to prioritize investments in technology that yield the highest financial and operational impact.

o   ¿Qué gestión se tiene establecida para dar seguimiento a los elementos del costo?

Based on the provided information, talisis has a multifaceted and evolving approach to cost management, involving strategic planning, continuous monitoring, and an increasing reliance on technology for efficiency. The management of cost elements is not merely about reduction but about optimising distribution and ensuring value generation.

Here is a detailed overview of the established cost management practices:

### 1. Centralised Financial Planning and Budgetary Control

The core of cost management at talisis resides in its financial and strategic planning functions. Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, highlights the importance of a well-structured financial setup, ensuring economic resources, a healthy profit and loss statement (P&L), balance sheet, and sufficient cash flow. His area is responsible for "administering debt and capital raising more efficiently" and "organising more efficiently where we allocate resources, in what cost item, in what expense item". This indicates a deliberate approach to resource allocation rather than reactive spending. The department engages in daily interactions with internal clients, including academic teams for faculty costs, operations for budget control, human resources for payroll, and marketing for revenue and expenditure forecasts. This broad interaction ensures a company-wide alignment on budget adherence and financial forecasting.

Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, reinforces this by stating her mission includes "leading budgetary planning" and "analysis of key indicators to improve efficiency and profitability". Her team provides financial information and analysis, guiding other departments on the responsible use of economic resources through "coaching or internal consulting" on business cases, productivity analysis, and cost-benefit assessments. A crucial short-term priority for her area is to "ensure that the minimum cash flow is covered" and manage the "recovery of the outstanding portfolio". This highlights a strong focus on immediate financial health in addition to long-term planning.

### 2. Strategic Cost Efficiency and Optimisation

talisis's approach to costs is centred on efficiency and optimisation rather than just cuts. Alberto Sánchez explicitly states that the goal for payroll is "how to make that payroll efficient – it doesn't mean reducing it, it doesn't necessarily mean increasing it, but how the payroll expense works in the most efficient way with the support of technology". This philosophy extends to all costs and expenses, where the aim is to distribute them "as efficiently as possible" by "making use of technology".

Marcela Valdez also champions "incremental productivity" as a key project, aiming to "serve more students with economies of scale". Her department acts as an "enabler" from the back office, ensuring administrative and financial processes support the growth and transformation driven by commercial and operational areas. This involves designing processes to support multi-channel and multi-product strategies, ensuring accurate financial reading and effective resource allocation. Simplification of administrative structures, such as reducing the number of legal entities, is also envisioned to "reduce the burden" and avoid unnecessary inter-company transactions.

Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, points to the need to "reduce the dispersion and atomisation of groups so that the teaching cost is naturally efficient," indicating an operational approach to managing faculty costs.

### 3. Leveraging Technology for Cost Management

Technology is increasingly seen as a critical enabler for efficient cost management.

- **Automation of Processes:** Alberto Sánchez envisions moving "beyond Excel" with "digital tools" to make budgeting and business cases "more automated, more modern, less artisanal". Juan Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, highlights "the automation of our processes" as a significant opportunity to make them "more effective, easier, more technological, with much faster real-time responses". Marcela Valdez also plans to use AI to "simplify the steps" in daily activities, from reconciliations to financial analysis.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Juan Arenas, COO, emphasises that AI will "automatise all activities that are not providing added value and are very manual" to reduce errors and facilitate "more exact data to make decisions that allow us to advance faster". Román de León, Data Scientist, also aims for agile decision-making and savings through "digital processes with reliable data" and "hyper-personalisation". His team is also proposing to "optimise the budget through an algorithm" for agile resource allocation.
- **Impact on Personnel and Resources:** Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, notes that AI has already "reduced both financial and personnel resources" in content creation. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, details plans to use AI to automate complex variable compensation calculations for sales advisors and to accelerate their productivity curve by providing quick access to information.
- **Addressing System Fragmentation:** Marcela Valdez explicitly highlights the "underutilised SAP" system and a "lack of interface" with the core student banner system, which leads to "open controls" and "discontrol". This fragmentation results in inefficient data collection and analysis, underscoring the need for integrated technological solutions. Román de León also points out "too many systems that work in isolation," causing "inconsistencies of data".

### 4. Key Cost Elements under Specific Management

Specific cost categories are under close scrutiny and have tailored management approaches:

- **Personnel (Payroll and Faculty):** This is consistently identified as an "important cost". Management focuses on making it "efficient" without necessarily reducing it, enhancing advisor productivity through AI, and addressing high turnover through technology-supported recruitment processes.
- **Marketing and Customer Acquisition (CAC):** Alberto Sánchez notes the considerable increase in marketing expenses in recent years and monitors the "relationship of how much we are spending in marketing and sales versus what we are bringing in new revenue". Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, aims to "improve the acquisition cost". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, strives to "optimise the CPL (Cost Per Lead)" which is "getting higher" due to market saturation. Katherine Romero, Senior Marketing Manager, views marketing as "key" to talisis's vision, aiming to capture attention in an "oversaturated market", and uses CAC as an indicator. This indicates a strategic approach to managing advertising spend and lead generation efficiency.
- **Technology and Infrastructure:** While technology is a cost-saving enabler, its own costs are managed. Carlos Villa, Mobile Dev Lead, acknowledges the "cost" associated with migrating to the cloud. The focus is on optimising server usage and leveraging open-source tools to avoid development from scratch, thus managing the expense. There's an ongoing effort to build "data architecture" and use "chatbots" to leverage AI and data for better insights and efficiency.

### 5. Measurement and Indicators of Success

To ensure effective cost management, various indicators and metrics are employed across different areas:

- **Financial Indicators:** These include debt-to-equity ratios, interest-to-EBITDA ratios, and EBITDA-to-debt ratios for specific projects like Promecap. Overall company results, including income growth, profitability, and net profit, are paramount. Marcela Valdez tracks "days of accounts receivable" and "days of accounts payable," along with "inventory days".
- **Productivity and Efficiency Metrics:** Marcela Valdez focuses on "incremental productivity" and monitors "new enrolments," "re-enrolments," "generation size," and "campus utilisation percentage". Humberto Salazar measures sales force productivity and acquisition cost. Lilian Lozano tracks CPL, conversion rates, and engagement for digital campaigns, along with the "percentage of processes within the marketing area that will be standardised" and the "percentage of our activities are supported by artificial intelligence".
- **Technology Adoption and Impact:** Juan Mendez measures "digital maturity index," "adoption of tools," "integration of tools," and "percentage of automated processes". Román de León also measures the "agility in the decision-making" process, the "number of departments that already use artificial intelligence in how many processes," and the "number of reports that currently exist that we can reduce to dynamic dashboards".
- **Quality and Satisfaction:** Juan Arenas monitors student satisfaction. Inge Ploennig's area monitors key academic indicators and aims for historical data to enable longitudinal analysis and deeper understanding of performance.

talisis's cost management is a dynamic and integrated process. It is established through rigorous financial planning, constant monitoring of key cost categories, a strong drive for operational and administrative efficiency (often through simplification), and a rapidly increasing reliance on advanced technology and data analytics to inform decisions and automate tasks. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure financial health while supporting the organisation's strategic objectives and transforming its educational offerings.

Given the emphasis on technology for cost efficiency and the challenges of system integration, I recommend a deep dive into the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) of current and planned technology investments**. This analysis should specifically quantify how integrated systems and AI/Cloud solutions are projected to reduce manual labour, improve data accuracy for decision-making, and directly impact key cost elements like personnel and marketing. This would provide concrete evidence for future investment prioritisation and highlight areas where technology adoption could yield the greatest financial benefits.

o   ¿Qué estrategias y/o proyectos se tienen establecidos para los principales elementos del costo?

talisis has established a comprehensive and dynamic set of strategies and projects to manage and optimise its principal cost elements, reflecting a shift from mere cost reduction to efficient resource allocation, strategic investment, and value creation. This approach is deeply integrated with the organisation's overall strategic planning and increasingly leverages technology.

The main cost elements under specific management include:

1. **General Costs and Financial Management**
2. **Personnel and Faculty Costs**
3. **Marketing and Customer Acquisition Costs**
4. **Technology and Infrastructure Costs**
5. **Strategic Investments and Expansion (CAPEX/OPEX)**

Here are the established strategies and projects for each:

### 1. General Costs and Financial Management

**Overall Strategy:** talisis's core financial strategy, led by the Director of Planning, Alberto Sánchez, focuses on maintaining a robust financial structure, ensuring sufficient economic resources, a healthy profit and loss (P&L) statement, a strong balance sheet, and adequate cash flow. The objective is to manage costs and expenses as "efficiently as possible" rather than simply reducing them, by strategically distributing resources "in what cost item, in what expense item". Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, adds that her mission includes "leading budgetary planning" and "analysis of key indicators to improve efficiency and profitability". Her team acts as an "enabler" from the back office, ensuring administrative and financial processes support multi-channel and multi-product growth.

**Key Projects & Initiatives:**

- **Budgetary Control and Forecasting:** The planning department is deeply involved in "control presupuestal" and "forecast" activities on a daily basis with operations, human resources, and marketing and commercial teams. They aim to make budgeting and business cases "more automated, more modern, less artisanal, less manual" through "digital tools".
- **Responsible Resource Utilisation:** The finance team provides "coaching or internal consulting" to other departments on business cases, productivity analysis, and cost-benefit assessments, to ensure the responsible use of economic resources across the organisation.
- **Cash Flow and Portfolio Management:** A critical short-term priority is to "ensure that the minimum cash flow is covered" and manage the "recovery of the outstanding portfolio" to maintain immediate financial health. Financial education and responsible payment practices are considered essential.
- **Incremental Productivity:** A key project is "incremental productivity," aiming to "serve more students with economies of scale". This involves optimising processes to cater to more students while achieving better cost efficiency.
- **Streamlining Administrative Processes:** While not explicitly detailed as a project, the overall strategy includes "simplification of administrative structures" such as reducing the number of legal entities to "reduce the burden" and avoid unnecessary inter-company transactions. This also extends to standardising and automating processes for "highs, lows and changes" for students, employees, and suppliers, which currently takes significant time and creates "descontrol".
- **Integrated Business Management:** The overarching "Business Management" project aims to have "2,400 mentes trabajando como una", indicating a unified and efficient management approach across the entire organisation, inherently driving cost optimisation. This is a "proyecto de mediano y largo plazo donde el orden, la disciplina y la visión tienen que compaginar con la cultura y la estrategia".

### 2. Personnel and Faculty Costs

**Overall Strategy:** Personnel costs, including payroll and faculty expenses, are identified as "un costo importante". The strategy is to "efficientar esa nómina," which "no quiere decir reducirla, no quiere decir aumentarla, necesariamente, sino es cómo es el gasto en nómina trabaja de la manera más eficiente con apoyo de tecnología". The academic department aims to "reducir la dispersión y atomización de grupos para que el costo docente naturalmente sea eficiente". There is also a focus on attracting, developing, and retaining key talent, particularly in high-turnover positions like sales advisors.

**Key Projects & Initiatives:**

- **Payroll Efficiency through Technology:** The main challenge is to make payroll efficient with the support of technology.
- **Automating Variable Compensation:** A specific initiative is to automate the "compensación variable de los de los promotores y asesores" which has been "muy complejo" due to the numerous variables involved. Automation would provide "muchísimo mayor visibilidad" to advisors and management.
- **Reducing Productivity Curve for Sales Advisors:** Utilise AI tools to help sales advisors "consultar las dudas que vaya teniendo en el día a día para que su desarrollo sea más rápido, y puedan ser y puedan tener esa productividad óptima en menos tiempo." The current optimal productivity curve is around 7 months, and the goal is to reduce it significantly.
- **Optimising Talent Acquisition:** Address high turnover by automating "contratación, las entrevistas, las referencias, la búsqueda de de del mejor talento" to reduce the current 40-50 day hiring process. The goal is to "traer el mejor talento" and ensure a "mejor fit para esa posición," focusing on rigour in internal staffing processes.
- **Strengthening Teaching Career (Carrera Docente):** A priority project is to "fortalecer la carrera docente", which aims to provide certainty and inspiration to faculty by supporting them with training to improve their practices.
- **Professional Development:** The formation of teams will focus on developing "habilidades blandas" (soft skills) like communication and empathy, alongside "habilidades tecnológicas" to enhance the student experience. For the planning team, the focus is on mastering finance, project evaluation, M&A, strategic planning, and communication, always "apoyándose en tecnología para optimizar tiempo y recursos". This includes continuous learning in new methodologies and technological advancements.
- **"Hiperformance Culture" Project:** This major initiative, led by Human Capital, aims to "optimizar el recurso humano en talisis" to "asegurar la rentabilidad del capital humano." It involves establishing high standards, attracting the best fit talent, clarity in roles, and continuous development. This culture aims to be the "principal driver" covering "relaciones laborales, del desarrollo de la estrategia, tema de comprensión y beneficios, el estilo estilo de mando de la gente que que necesitamos tener, los procesos de atracción y reclutamiento y evaluación de gente, tener la estructura organizacional óptima para operar de forma productiva los procesos de análisis, la cultura de chain management, y de mejora continua".

### 3. Marketing and Customer Acquisition Costs

**Overall Strategy:** Marketing expenses have increased "de manera considerable" in recent years, not just in education but across all sectors. The challenge is to manage these costs "de manera eficiente" while competing on the same platforms. The strategy involves optimising marketing and sales spend against new revenue generated, aiming to "mejorar el costo de adquisición" and "optimise the CPL (Cost Per Lead)". This requires evolving from traditional marketing to an approach that prioritises emotional connection, clear differentiation, and long-term relationships with students.

**Key Projects & Initiatives:**

- **Omnichannel Strategy:** A priority project is to implement an "estrategia omnicanal, integral" across all digital and physical touchpoints to ensure "coherencia de comunicación de cada una de nuestras marcas". This involves integrating "medios digitales, experiencias presenciales, contenidos y aliados estratégicos con visión de largo plazo".
- **Brand Building and Strengthening:** Another key project is the "construcción, y fortalecimiento de marca, por cada una de nuestras unidades de de negocio," consolidating "narrativas diferenciadas coherentes" aligned with the 2035 vision. The goal is to create brands that resonate emotionally and reflect talisis's capacity to transform lives.
- **Automation and Personalisation with AI:** Leveraging AI for "segmentación hiper personalizada" to tailor messages, channels, and experiences for each buyer persona in real-time. This allows for "automatización creativa" to generate content at scale without sacrificing quality, enabling A/B testing and campaigns that evolve based on performance. The aim is for the marketing team to focus on strategy rather than operational execution. AI is also used for "personalización en tiempo real".
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implement "análisis predictivo y decisiones basadas en en datos" to anticipate enrolments, dropouts, or changes in trends, allowing for proactive interventions. This aims for "dashboards más inteligentes con acciones sugeridas" to take "decisiones en tiempo real y no reactivos".
- **Market Intelligence:** Conduct "un ejercicio de inteligencia de mercados para para llegar a las organizaciones que todavía no llegamos con precisamente ese portafolio ordenado para las empresas". This involves understanding "quién necesita educación, cómo la está buscando, qué lo motiva, cómo prefiere aprender".
- **Digital Ambassadors Program:** Develop a "programa de embajadores digitales, que nos permita crear una red que voceros orgánicos en nuestros diferentes canales de digitales".
- **Digital Playbook:** Create a "playbook digital" to "alinear procesos, lineamientos y tener una estrategia mucho más práctica de cómo trabaja el equipo".

### 4. Technology and Infrastructure Costs

**Overall Strategy:** Technology is viewed as a critical enabler for efficiency and a "músculo operativo" for talisis. The goal is to move beyond manual processes and Excel-based operations towards automated, modern, and real-time digital tools. AI and cloud technology are central to this transformation, aiming to "potenciar" human capabilities rather than replace them, fostering "humanos súper humanos". This requires a significant investment and a strategy to manage associated costs while gaining efficiency.

**Key Projects & Initiatives:**

- **AI-Driven Automation of Core Processes:** Implement AI for "forecast y presupuesto" to achieve greater precision. AI will also aid in "evaluación de proyectos y evaluación de empresas" and "fusiones de adquisiciones" by helping to "targetear" potential acquisitions. AI is expected to "simplificar los pasos" in daily activities, from reconciliations to financial analysis.
- **Cloud Migration and Asynchronous Collaboration:** Migrating to the cloud is underway, which brings "costo" but enables "trabajar de manera asíncrona" and boosts efficiency. The security of cloud services is also a recognised concern that needs protection.
- **Data Architecture and Analytics:** A priority project is to "construir esta arquitectura de datos" to collect comprehensive information on students, faculty, and administrative staff. This aims to provide a "visibilidad organizacional completa, una vista 360 de nuestros clientes" to understand their needs and offer personalised support. This includes creating "dashboards de indicadores clave" and moving from "reportes que hoy en día existen que podamos reducirlos a unos tableros dinámicos con mayor frecuencia de actualización".
- **Integrated Systems:** A major challenge is the "fragmentación" and "lack of interface" between existing systems like SAP and the core student banner system, leading to "open controls" and "discontrol". A key initiative is to "consolidar, este, todos los ecosistemas en plataformas interconectadas", envisioned as "Arquitectura Tecnológica IA: La mente TALISIS conectando todo". This aims to overcome "inconsistencies de datos" due to "demasiados sistemas que trabajan en aislamiento".
- **Chatbots and AI Assistants:** Projects include "Chatbots Educativos" and an "Asistente Virtual Administrativo (proyecto Mazinger Z)," which has already "reduced both financial and personnel resources" in content creation. There are also plans for "tutorías y mentorías personalizadas apoyadas en IA" for students and collaborators.
- **Standardisation of Processes:** Acknowledging that currently "trabajamos con tareas y estas tareas están asignadas a personas," there is a need to move towards "flujos definidos y automatizados" to achieve "muchísima velocidad" in service resolution. This includes efforts to standardise and document processes.
- **Budget Optimisation through Algorithms:** A specific project is proposed to "optimice el presupuesto disponible basado en las necesidades reales... por medio de un algoritmo," to allocate resources more agilely and align with organisational objectives.

### 5. Strategic Investments and Expansion (CAPEX/OPEX)

**Overall Strategy:** Investment decisions are strategically planned to align with market trends and support long-term objectives. This involves efficient administration of "deuda y capital" and constant communication with all areas to evaluate new projects. The goal is to find financially viable expansion models that are replicable.

**Key Projects & Initiatives:**

- **Promecap Exit Strategy:** A long-term priority is to "encontrar la mejor salida para Promecap" by generating "suficiente caja y el generar suficiente EBITDA" to manage debt and ensure a healthy balance sheet. This indicates a strategic financial management of a specific asset.
- **Multibrand Presence Optimisation:** The project focuses on "cómo utilizamos de manera más eficiente toda la presencia que tenemos tanto en en UR, como en Harmon Hall, como en Unit," aiming for a "tema multimarca o tema consolidado". This implies optimising the combined operations for greater efficiency and scale. It also involves "escalabilidad de costos para tener escalabilidad de precios" to make products more economical and reach a wider audience.
- **U-ERRE Regional Expansion:** Explore "la expansión de URL" to become a "fortaleza regional" outside of Monterrey. The primary challenge for this expansion is economic, requiring "dinero".
- **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** A long-term project involves "empezar a ver este, a quién podemos comprar, con quién nos podemos fusionar". This also presents an "economic" challenge related to "levantar capital o... levantar deuda". IA is envisioned to play a key role in "targetear" potential companies for M&A, providing precision in identifying and evaluating opportunities.
- **New Learning Centres/Portfolio Expansion:** Priorities include "la apertura de nuevos centros de aprendizaje" and "la apertura de nuevo portafolio que de acuerdo a las necesidades del mercado". This also extends to "expandir con nuevos modelos," such as "hubs, Talysis, un estudio, un piloto, o modelos de de franquicias, o o de operaciones propias en ciudades estratégicas" that require "menos inversión que un campus completo". These models aim to be "más viables financieramente" and foster interaction with students in strategic cities, while also driving sales and brand positioning.

talisis's approach to cost management is strategic, integrated, and forward-looking. It combines meticulous financial planning and control with a strong emphasis on leveraging technology (especially AI and cloud) to automate processes, gain real-time insights, and empower human talent. The organisation is actively undertaking various projects to optimise core operational costs, enhance marketing efficiency, and enable sustainable growth through strategic investments and innovative educational models.

To refine these strategies and projects, I recommend conducting a **cost-benefit analysis of specific technology investments** across different departments. This analysis should quantify the expected financial returns (e.g., labour cost savings, increased productivity, improved retention, higher conversion rates) against the investment in new systems, AI tools, and training programs. This would help prioritise technology initiatives that offer the highest tangible benefits and ensure that technology spend is directly correlated with a positive impact on the organisation's "salud financiera".

o   ¿Está claro para la organización cómo contribuye cada una de las áreas y puestos al resultado de negocio?

Tali here, while individual leaders within talisis generally demonstrate a clear understanding of how their specific areas and positions contribute to business results, there is a recurring theme across various interviews indicating that the _inter-departmental clarity, alignment, and integrated understanding_ of contributions are areas targeted for significant improvement.

**Areas Demonstrating Clarity of Contribution:**

Many leaders articulate their area's direct impact and role:

- **Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación):** Views his area as ensuring financial structure, economic resources, and a healthy balance sheet, aligning strategic and financial planning with market trends. He primarily interacts with internal clients (academy for costs, operations for budget control, HR for payroll, marketing for income forecasts). His team also aligns with the CEO on strategic direction, new projects, and M&A.
- **Alejandro Madrazo (Director Académico):** Clearly defines his area as the "epicenter of innovation" for educational design, deployment, and evaluation, contributing to talisis's vision of accessible, quality education and rethinking institutional organization. He emphasizes that other areas must understand the importance of academic work.

- **Román de León (Data Scientist):** His area builds data-driven technological solutions, using AI to personalize learning and assist both internal collaborators and students. He sees his team as key to detecting patterns and supporting decision-making.

**Areas Where Clarity and Alignment Are Sought or Challenged:**

Despite individual clarity, a common thread among leaders is the ongoing effort to enhance inter-area clarity and collaboration:

- **Lack of Integrated Processes and Communication:**
    - **Alejandro Madrazo** points out inefficiencies due to a lack of clear and documented processes, leading to constant emergency interruptions. He also states that all areas need to _understand_ the importance of academic work and time.
    - **Domingo Farias** admits "poor organizational design," "lack of structure," and "lack of alignment" hinder Human Capital's impact on teacher profiles. He calls for "clear communication and documented, respect for processes" as needed support.
    - **Fernando de Río** highlights that "platforms do not converse well," data is "dispersed or unreliable," and automation is hard to scale. He mentions that "here in talisis they don't like to share direction, each one wants their own way," necessitating "strategic collaboration" and "clear governance".
    - **Juan Mendez** emphasizes the challenge of truly instilling the "talisis ADN" into every individual's daily actions. He notes "lack of clarity on the vision and strategy from the high direction" and a need for "alignment" and "communication" from other areas.
    - **Juliana Effting** states that talisis "still has much to do in more strategic terms" regarding its digital identity from high leadership, and that "processes, rules...dominate" over listening to customer needs. She needs "clear communication to all of talisis" from leaders about the digital transformation.
    - **Luis Ruiz** expresses feeling "a little isolated in this collaboration" and desires "more direct interactions and with that unified focus and vision". He also needs "time and clear definitions regarding the processes" to deliver quality work.
    - **Marcela Valdez** notes a "lack of integration between systems" leading to "open controls and risks of descontrol," and the absence of a well-designed master data and periodic closures causes discrepancies with accounting.
    - **Marcos Samaniego** identifies the need for a "centralized document repository of all processes" due to the company's size, to ensure consistent communication and avoid duplications.
    - **Mariel Serrano** highlights the obstacle of "collaborators not understanding" and thus not committing to the transversal talisis Bit project, and the "arduous work" of achieving "100% effective alignment among all areas". She needs "openness and coordination between areas to build aligned messages" and avoid "silos that fragment the institutional narrative".
    - **Paul Moch** hints at a need for greater understanding of education's central role over business and flexibility in processes for innovation.
    - **Román de León** frequently mentions that departments "don't validate with us the solution they want to achieve," and often seek his team's input too late in the process, leading to delays and misalignments. He identifies "lack of clear definition of some of the metrics" and "too many systems that work in an isolated manner" as causes for data inconsistencies. He also needs "much communication between departments" to achieve a "clear vision" for the organization's future.

**Inference from the Information:**

It is evident that talisis is actively working towards greater clarity and alignment regarding each area's contribution to business results. The recurring emphasis on "talisis Way" culture, shared objectives (OKRs/KPIs), and strategic communication (connections, town halls, conventions) points to a top-down effort to foster this understanding. However, the operational reality still presents challenges with fragmented systems, undocumented processes, and a need for deeper, earlier inter-departmental collaboration and a more robust shared understanding of long-term strategic direction. The desire for "co-creation" rather than a client-supplier relationship between internal departments is a key indicator of where current clarity falls short and what is being strived for.

To address the identified gaps in inter-departmental clarity and collaboration, Tali recommends conducting a detailed **Process Mapping and Stakeholder Alignment Workshop** for key cross-functional initiatives. This would involve identifying critical value streams, mapping existing processes end-to-end, identifying points of friction, communication gaps, and data inconsistencies, and collaboratively designing improved workflows with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and expected contributions for each area. This framework can help transform the desired "orchestrated" collaboration into a tangible operational reality by simplifying complex interdependencies into a more easily understandable system.


o   ¿Están convencidos de que sus actividades y esfuerzos están alineados a contribuir con el resultado de negocio? Y ¿Hasta qué nivel de la organización se permea esa conciencia de afectación al resultado financiero con sus actividades propias?

Based on the detailed insights from the interviews, it is evident that leaders across various departments at talisis exhibit a strong conviction regarding how their specific activities and efforts contribute to overall business results. However, the permeation of this understanding, particularly in terms of its direct impact on _inter-departmental financial efficiency and integrated operational alignment_, presents a more nuanced picture with discernible opportunities for enhancement.

**Conviction of Alignment with Business Results**

A consistent theme across the interviews is the clear articulation by individual leaders of their area's strategic importance and its direct or indirect link to talisis's business outcomes. This conviction is deeply embedded at the leadership level:

- **Strategic & Financial Planning:** Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación) explicitly links his area's role to ensuring a "healthy balance sheet," "economic resources," and aligning strategic and financial planning with market trends to achieve the company's objectives over the next decade. He constantly interacts with internal departments (academia for costs, operations for budget control, HR for payroll, marketing for income forecasts) to ensure financial structure and efficient resource allocation.
- **Academic Leadership:** Alejandro Madrazo (Director Académico) positions his area as the "epicentre of innovation" for educational design and deployment, directly contributing to talisis's vision of accessible, quality education. He understands that this academic work is fundamental for the organisation's core value proposition and, implicitly, its market standing.
- **Commercial & Marketing:** Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) directly states that his area is the "growth engine of the organization," crucial for student acquisition and retention, which is vital for achieving talisis's 2035 growth vision. Fernando de Río (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) envisions his area as the "motor that converts strategy into real, sustainable, and people-centered growth," driving market intelligence, brand evolution, and efficient acquisition funnels. Katherine Romero (Senior Marketing Manager) similarly highlights marketing's role in "translating the vision into positioning and action," building brand identity, and accelerating growth by connecting with real people, asserting that every marketing action has a "direct impact on the student". Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) also directly links her team's efforts to "scaling the business" through customer acquisition strategies.
- **Operations:** Juan Arenas (COO) defines his area as the "integrative of all ideas, projects, initiatives," serving as "enablers of the operation" that directly interact with students to deliver the best service. He emphasizes "accountability" for service quality as fundamental. Marcos Samaniego (Director de Operaciones Académicas) sees his area as the implementer of academic design, ensuring that what is planned actually "succeeds in the campuses," and monitoring progress towards institutional objectives.
- **Human Capital:** Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) states her area's impact is in "securing the best talent" to fulfill the value promise and transform lives, directly supporting leaders to develop their teams. Domingo Farias (Human Capital) refers to his area as the "engine of attitude and energy", attracting talent for a high-performance culture and explicitly linking HR efforts to "company results," "revenue growth," and "profitability".
- **Technology & Data:** Carlos Granados (CIO) aims to create an "intelligent, adaptive, and inclusive educational ecosystem" that improves "operational efficiency". Luis Ruiz (Gerente de desarrollo de software) sees his work on system integrations and AI agents as fundamental for making work more efficient for all users. Román de León (Data Scientist) focuses on building data-driven solutions and applying AI for personalised learning and strategic decision-making, which he sees as crucial for talisis to become a national and international educational leader.
- **Quality & Transformation:** Inge Ploennig (Director de Calidad y Acreditación Académica) frames accreditation as a "motor for real enhancement" across the institution, aligning with the mission. Juan Mendez (Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación) views his department as "architects of systemic change" focusing on design, activation, and sustaining transformation across processes, capabilities, technology, and culture, aiming for "everyone to know why they are doing what they are doing".
- **Leadership & Culture:** Joel Enriquez (CSO) focuses on building a "strategic legacy" and being a "founder of organizational culture," giving "relevance and echo to what we do as a group". Mariel Serrano (Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence) works to reinforce service excellence, build reputation, and promote the "talisis Way" culture, emphasising "organisational synchronicity" and a "shared vision" to consolidate leadership.

This strong conviction among leaders is further supported by the "Reporte_Nicho.pdf," which outlines "Iniciativas estratégicas interconectadas que materializan la visión mediante cultura de alto desempeño, tecnología habilitadora y modelos educativos innovadores". It specifically mentions "Proyectos de alineación cultural," "arquitectura tecnológica IA," "perfilamiento docente," "vinculación productiva," "omnicanalidad," and "business management integrado," all with "métricas claras" like "empleabilidad," "NPS," "retención," and "impacto comunitario medible". This top-down strategic framing reinforces the perceived alignment.

**Permeation of Financial Awareness**

While the conviction of _their own_ contribution is clear, the _pervasive and integrated awareness_ of how daily activities affect the broader financial results, especially across inter-departmental boundaries, shows areas for improvement. This awareness is strongest at senior and executive levels, but challenges emerge as one descends into the operational nuances and cross-functional dependencies.

**1. Strong Financial Awareness at Senior Levels:** Leaders in finance, planning, and growth roles consistently articulate their direct impact on financial outcomes and the need for fiscal responsibility:

- Marcela Valdez (Directora de Administración y Finanzas) details her mission to "ensure the accuracy of accounting and financial operations for decision-making, lead budget planning, analyze key indicators to improve efficiency and profitability, comply with tax regulations and proactively manage risks". She highlights her area's role in making resources available responsibly and "coaching or internal consulting" on productivity and cost-benefit. She identifies key indicators such as "days of accounts receivable," "EBITDA," and "revenue growth".
- Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación) constantly discusses "administering debt efficiently," "raising capital," and "assigning resources". He ensures that "there is budget for all costs and expenses" and emphasizes efficient budget management with those who "exercise" or "administer" it.
- Fernando de Río (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) references "desaceleración económica y la presión por la rentabilidad" and the student's need to value "costo beneficio". He also works with finance to determine "dónde invertir con inteligencia".
- Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) aims to "mejorar el costo de adquisición y el aumento de la productividad de la fuerza de ventas", indicating direct financial performance metrics.

**2. Challenges in Inter-Departmental Permeation and Operational Integration:**

Despite the high-level financial awareness, several recurring obstacles hinder its full permeation and seamless execution across the entire organisation:

- **Fragmented Systems and Data Inconsistency:** A significant barrier to consolidated financial awareness is the lack of integrated systems and reliable data. Marcela Valdez explicitly mentions "lack of integration between systems" like SAP and Core Banner, leading to "open controls and risks of descontrol" and data discrepancies. Román de León (Data Scientist) echoes this, noting "too many systems that work in an isolated manner" causing "inconsistencies of data between those platforms". Katherine Romero (Senior Marketing Manager) also observes that "some platforms today do not allow automation or measurement of our projects or indicators fluently". This fragmented data environment makes it challenging to have a real-time, unified view of financial performance across all operations.
- **Lack of Standardised Processes and Documentation:** Several leaders highlight inefficiencies due to undefined or undocumented processes. Alejandro Madrazo (Director Académico) points to the absence of "sufficiently clear and documented processes" as a cause of constant emergency interruptions, hindering efficient planning. Marcos Samaniego (Director de Operaciones Académicas) advocates for a "centralized document repository of all processes" because the company is "too large and there are many processes happening" without a unified source of truth, leading to potential duplication and miscommunication. Luis Ruiz (Gerente de desarrollo de software) also explicitly states the need for "clear definitions regarding the processes" to avoid delays and ensure quality work. This lack of standardisation directly impacts cost efficiency and shared understanding of financial impact.
- **Communication Gaps and Siloed Operations:** A pervasive issue is the difficulty in fostering true cross-functional collaboration. Fernando de Río (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) states bluntly that "here in talisis they don't like to share direction, each one wants their own way", which can lead to misaligned priorities and inefficient resource allocation. Román de León (Data Scientist) describes a "client-provider relationship" between departments, where he is often sought too late, hindering co-creation of optimal solutions. Mariel Serrano (Head of Corporate Reputation) acknowledges that "collaborators do not understand" the "talisis Bit" project, leading to a lack of commitment, and the "arduous work" of achieving "100% effective alignment among all areas". She needs "openness and coordination between areas to build aligned messages" and avoid "silos that fragment the institutional narrative". Juliana Effting (Directora de Educación Online) needs "clear communication to all of talisis" from leaders about the digital transformation to foster aligned contributions. These issues suggest that while leaders might understand their own financial contribution, the collective financial impact of interdependent activities is not always transparent or optimally coordinated across the full breadth of the organisation.
- **Cultural Resistance to Change and Innovation:** Paulina Adalid (Rector Institucional in UNID) notes "not wanting to accept changes" and a tendency for staff to work in a "more conservative" manner, hindering innovation, which impacts the adoption of new, potentially more efficient or financially viable processes. Juan Mendez (Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación) also highlights "resistancia cultural" and a "lack of digital capabilities" as challenges to making processes more "intelligent" and "faster".
- **Resource and Time Constraints:** Paul Moch (Vice President for Teaching & Learning) explicitly mentions "time" and "lack of hands" as major obstacles to focusing on strategic design and innovation, implying that day-to-day operational demands consume resources that could otherwise be dedicated to more financially impactful long-term projects. Román de León (Data Scientist) similarly describes the "size of the team" and "current workload" as primary obstacles, along with the "lack of sufficiently trained people in technology", impeding agile project advancement. Domingo Farias (Human Capital) seeks "greater visibility of the productivity of other positions" beyond sales advisors, implying a gap in understanding broad operational efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

In essence, talisis's senior and mid-level leadership are highly convinced of their individual areas' contributions to business results, often articulating these in terms of growth, profitability, efficiency, and student success. However, the comprehensive permeation of this financial awareness into _seamless, integrated, and consistently executed inter-departmental operations_ remains an ongoing strategic imperative. The primary challenges lie in overcoming fragmented technological systems, standardising diverse operational processes, fostering genuine cross-functional communication, addressing cultural resistance to change, and ensuring adequate allocation of human resources to strategic, rather than purely reactive, activities. The "talisis Way" culture and initiatives like "talisis Bit" represent a clear top-down effort to foster this unified consciousness and alignment, but their full operational manifestation is still evolving.

To concretely address the identified gaps in inter-departmental financial awareness and operational alignment, Tali suggests initiating a **"Value Stream Analysis & Cross-Functional Accountability Design"** program. This would involve selecting 2-3 critical, end-to-end organisational processes (e.g., student acquisition to retention, or new product development to market launch) that cut across multiple departments and applying value stream mapping. For each mapped process, clearly delineate where value is created, where waste/inefficiencies occur, and, crucially, identify the precise financial impact (costs, revenue generation, risk) at each step. Following this, convene cross-functional teams to collectively _design accountability matrices_ for these specific value streams, ensuring shared ownership of financial outcomes, and integrating clear, consistent data dashboards accessible to all involved parties. This approach moves beyond general awareness to embed specific financial responsibility within collective operational flows, fostering a culture of co-ownership for measurable business results.
### VII. Procesos y Sistema de Gestión

o   ¿Las Metodologías, Procesos y Sistemas se considera una Inversión o un Gasto?

Based on the comprehensive insights gleaned from the provided interviews, Methodologies, Processes, and Systems are consistently perceived by talisis's senior leadership team as a crucial **investment**, rather than merely an operational expense. This perspective is an inference drawn from the recurring strategic justifications, long-term visions, and expected returns articulated across various departments.

Here is a detailed elaboration of why these elements are considered an investment:

### 1. Strategic Enablers for Long-Term Vision

talisis's leadership views methodologies, processes, and systems as fundamental to achieving its ambitious strategic vision for 2035 [Alberto Sánchez 2, 10, 12, 27; Álvaro García 56, 58, 74, 77; Carlos Granados 98; Fernando de Río 189, 190, 191; Humberto 225, 231; Inge Ploennig 239, 244, 258, 261, 262; Joel Enriquez 287, 289; Juan Arenas 296, 300, 303; Juan Mendez 303, 304, 305, 310, 311, 313, 314; Juliana Effting 335, 336, 339, 346, 349; Katherine 365, 367, 368; Lilian Lozano 406, 411, 415, 416, 420; Luis 430, 433, 436; Marcela Valdez 445, 448, 449, 455, 456, 460, 461, 463; Marcos Samaniego 480, 485, 488, 489, 490, 491, 495, 499; Mariel 502, 505, 506, 508, 514; Paul Moch 528, 529, 531, 533, 535, 538; Paulina 544, 550, 552; Román de León 567, 576, 577, 583, 585, 587, 593]. The aim is not merely to cover immediate operational needs but to build lasting capabilities that will redefine education access, personalise learning experiences, and establish talisis as a leading educational ecosystem. For instance, Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, envisions designing structures that "survive beyond fads or current circumstances" and "grow with firm values and a very clear shared purpose". Similarly, Paulina, from UNID, highlights forming students with "knowledge and skills necessary to professionally develop in this continuously changing world", aided by technological tools.

### 2. Driving Efficiency and Productivity

A consistent justification for these investments is the anticipated significant gains in efficiency, reduction of manual tasks, and increased productivity across the organisation [Alberto Sánchez 10, 11; Álvaro García 58, 72, 78; Carlos Granados 98; Carlos Villa 109, 125; Domingo Farias 156, 157, 162; Fernando de Río 191, 204, 206; Humberto 232; Inge Ploennig 259, 261, 271; Juan Arenas 303, 304; Juan Mendez 314, 325; Juliana Effting 346, 348, 349; Katherine 376, 377, 378; Lilian Lozano 416, 417; Luis 434; Marcela Valdez 446, 455, 456, 460, 461, 463; Marcos Samaniego 488, 491; Mariel 506; Paulina 552; Román de León 585, 596]. Leaders envision automating repetitive activities, streamlining workflows, and leveraging technology to free up human talent for higher-value, more strategic tasks. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly links technology to "simplifying the steps we follow to do our daily activity" and "analysis of information and understanding the variables that impact profitability". Román de León, Data Scientist, also points out that digital processes and reliable data enable continuous project creation, contributing to "agility in decision-making" and "savings in day-to-day processes".

### 3. Risk Mitigation and Enhanced Control

Investing in well-defined processes, robust controls, and integrated systems is seen as critical for mitigating financial risks, preventing operational discrepancies, ensuring data accuracy, and safeguarding the institution's reputation [Alberto Sánchez 2; Marcela Valdez 448, 465, 466, 467, 469; Mariel 512, 513; Román de León 578]. Marcela Valdez highlights the "lack of interface" and "lack of design in the implementation" between systems (like Banner and SAP) leading to "open controls" and "discontrol", which are risks that need to be closed through investment in proper systems. These are protective investments that aim to avert larger, potentially more damaging, future costs.

### 4. Enabling Scalability and Growth

The ability to expand geographically, offer new products, and reach more students (both B2C and B2B) is consistently linked to having scalable processes and integrated technological platforms [Álvaro García 58; Fernando de Río 190, 215; Humberto 233, 234; Juliana Effting 339, 352; Katherine 368, 372; Lilian Lozano 406; Marcela Valdez 470, 471]. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, stresses the need for "a product that truly wins in the market" through "new models" of expansion like franchises or hubs. Similarly, Humberto, from the commercial area, identifies the "opening of new learning centers" and "new portfolios" as long-term impacts facilitated by automation of the commercial process. This directly ties these areas to core business growth strategies.

### 5. Investment in Human Capital and Culture

Leaders emphasise the need to invest in continuous training, upskilling, and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration, which goes hand-in-hand with implementing new technologies and methodologies [Alberto Sánchez 12, 13, 14, 15; Carlos Granados 100; Domingo Farias 33, 152, 158, 160, 161; Fernando de Río 201, 202, 206; Lilian Lozano 412, 413, 414, 418, 419; Juan Mendez 310, 311, 314, 318, 319; Juliana Effting 340, 345, 352; Katherine 378, 379, 385; Luis 434, 435; Marcela Valdez 448, 455, 460; Marcos Samaniego 485, 490; Mariel 503, 505; Paul Moch 534; Paulina 551, 553; Román de León 579, 587, 588]. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, highlights the importance of fostering a "culture of development in all areas" and Marcela Valdez mentions fostering the "professional development of the team" as part of her mission. This holistic view acknowledges that the "hardware" (systems) requires parallel investment in the "software" (people and culture) for optimal performance.

### 6. Explicit Financial Justifications and Metrics

Some interviewees directly mention financial justifications and metrics characteristic of investments. Carlos Granados, for example, discusses "Costos-beneficios" (cost-benefits), "TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)," and "ROI esperado" (expected ROI) for technology. Marcela Valdez, from finance, focuses on maximising "resources that are scarce" and achieving "profitability", including "rentabilidad por programa, por ubicación" which directly relates to the return on investment in academic offerings. Performance indicators often include improved conversion rates, reduced acquisition costs, retention rates, and productivity, all measures of return on initial outlay [Fernando de Río 217; Katherine 398; Lilian Lozano 427; Luis 439, 441; Marcos Samaniego 497; Juliana Effting 358; Román de León 596, 597].

### 7. Cost of Inaction (Lack of Investment)

Several leaders implicitly underscore the investment nature by lamenting the high costs, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities resulting from a lack of proper systems, integrated technology, or standardised processes [Álvaro García 78; Carlos Villa 131; Domingo Farias 33, 162; Fernando de Río 216, 392, 393, 425; Inge Ploennig 258, 259, 274; Juliana Effting 351, 356; Katherine 392, 393; Lilian Lozano 425, 426; Luis 437; Marcela Valdez 465, 466, 467, 472, 473; Marcos Samaniego 496, 499; Román de León 578, 595]. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, notes that not having a consolidated quality system in place "generates re-work at all levels, physical resources, financial resources, it is stressful and leads to greater expense". Román de León points out that inadequate data quality and isolated systems lead to "inconsistencies of data" and "rework" outside of systems. These "costs of not investing" highlight that proactive investment is seen as financially prudent in the long run.

### 8. Systemic and Fractal Approach

talisis operates as a "fractal organisation where principles are replicated at every level". The corporate level "centralises and optimises," while brands "preserve their identity," campuses "respond to local needs," and classrooms are "laboratories of transformation". This implies that investments in methodologies, processes, and systems at the central level are designed to flow down and enable efficiencies, innovation, and quality improvements at all operational levels, creating a cohesive and adaptable ecosystem. This systemic view further reinforces that these are foundational, long-term investments rather than isolated expenses.

The pervasive language used by talisis's leaders, which links methodologies, processes, and systems to strategic transformation, long-term efficiency, competitive advantage, and measurable returns, clearly positions them as **investments** in the organisation's future. The focus is on building sustainable capabilities that will yield significant benefits and value over time, going far beyond mere immediate cost coverage.

For our next step, we could delve into the specific strategies talisis plans to use to measure the return on these investments, drawing on the quantifiable metrics and planned initiatives mentioned in the interviews.

o   ¿Qué modelos, sistemas o herramientas se tienen disponibles de manera institucional?

Based on the comprehensive insights gleaned from the provided interviews and the "Reporte_Nicho.pdf", Methodologies, Processes, and Systems are consistently perceived by talisis's senior leadership team as a crucial **investment**, rather than merely an operational expense. This perspective is an inference drawn from the recurring strategic justifications, long-term visions, and expected returns articulated across various departments.

Here is a detailed elaboration of why these elements are considered an investment:

### 1. Strategic Enablers for Long-Term Vision

talisis's leadership views methodologies, processes, and systems as fundamental to achieving its ambitious strategic vision for 2035.

For instance, Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, envisions designing structures that "survive beyond fads or current circumstances" and "grow with firm values and a very clear shared purpose". Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional at UNID, highlights forming students with "knowledge and skills necessary to professionally develop in this continuously changing world", aided by technological tools. Carlos Granados, CIO, aims for "the creation of an intelligent, adaptive and inclusive educational ecosystem" through these agents. Similarly, Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, foresees talisis becoming "an internationally recognised entity for its competency-based and employability models" by 2035, underpinned by product flexibility and technological skills development.

### 2. Driving Efficiency and Productivity

A consistent justification for these investments is the anticipated significant gains in efficiency, reduction of manual tasks, and increased productivity across the organisation. Leaders envision automating repetitive activities, streamlining workflows, and leveraging technology to free up human talent for higher-value, more strategic tasks. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly links technology to "simplifying the steps we follow to do our daily activity" and "analysis of information and understanding the variables that impact profitability". Román de León, Data Scientist, also points out that digital processes and reliable data enable continuous project creation, contributing to "agility in decision-making" and "savings in day-to-day processes". Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, notes the complexity of calculating variable compensation for promoters and advisors due to numerous variables and sees automation as a solution to provide better visibility and project compensation over time.

### 3. Risk Mitigation and Enhanced Control

Investing in well-defined processes, robust controls, and integrated systems is seen as critical for mitigating financial risks, preventing operational discrepancies, ensuring data accuracy, and safeguarding the institution's reputation. Marcela Valdez highlights the "lack of interface" and "lack of design in the implementation" between systems (like Banner and SAP) leading to "open controls" and "discontrol", which are risks that need to be closed through investment in proper systems. Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, emphasises the need to "blindar y comunicar que somos una compañía, un ecosistema que sirve mejor que nunca siempre", identifying risks like desinformation, virality, and cancellation culture if not managed intelligently. These are protective investments that aim to avert larger, potentially more damaging, future costs.

### 4. Enabling Scalability and Growth

The ability to expand geographically, offer new products, and reach more students (both B2C and B2B) is consistently linked to having scalable processes and integrated technological platforms. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, stresses the need for "a product that truly wins in the market" through "new models" of expansion like franchises or hubs, designed to be "financially viable" and generate sales and brand positioning. Humberto, from the commercial area, identifies the "opening of new learning centers" and "new portfolios" as long-term impacts facilitated by automation of the commercial process. Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, highlights the opportunity for "positioning Athalysis and its learning institutions very well, in each of the segments and reaching out with a single block of products and services". This directly ties these areas to core business growth strategies.

### 5. Investment in Human Capital and Culture

Leaders emphasise the need to invest in continuous training, upskilling, and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration, which goes hand-in-hand with implementing new technologies and methodologies. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, highlights the importance of fostering a "culture of development in all areas" and Marcela Valdez mentions fostering the "professional development of the team" as part of her mission. Joel Enriquez speaks about his role as "a founder of organisational culture" that should transcend time. This holistic view acknowledges that the "hardware" (systems) requires parallel investment in the "software" (people and culture) for optimal performance. Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, notes the importance of a "mentality of tech growth" and a "discipline to learn all the time" within his team.

### 6. Explicit Financial Justifications and Metrics

Some interviewees directly mention financial justifications and metrics characteristic of investments. Carlos Granados, CIO, for example, discusses "Costos-beneficios" (cost-benefits), "TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)," and "ROI esperado" (expected ROI) for technology. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, focuses on maximising "resources that are scarce" and achieving "profitability", including "profitability per programme, per location" which directly relates to the return on investment in academic offerings. Performance indicators often include improved conversion rates, reduced acquisition costs, retention rates, and productivity, all measures of return on initial outlay. Álvaro García highlights "impacto económico" and "eficiencia operativa con márgenes y gastos" as key indicators. Lilian Lozano mentions "CPL" (cost per lead) and "tasa de conversión". The emphasis on these quantifiable returns demonstrates a clear investment mindset.

### 7. Cost of Inaction (Lack of Investment)

Several leaders implicitly underscore the investment nature by lamenting the high costs, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities resulting from a lack of proper systems, integrated technology, or standardised processes. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, notes that not having a consolidated quality system in place "generates re-work at all levels, physical resources, financial resources, it is stressful and leads to greater expense". Román de León points out that inadequate data quality and isolated systems lead to "inconsistencies of data" and "rework" outside of systems. Marcela Valdez mentions the lack of integration between SAP and Banner resulting in "descontrol" and a "risk that we must seek to close". These "costs of not investing" highlight that proactive investment is seen as financially prudent in the long run.

### 8. Systemic and Layered Approach

talisis operates with a layered organisational structure where principles are replicated at every level. The corporate level "centralises and optimises," while brands "preserve their identity," campuses "respond to local needs," and classrooms are "laboratories of transformation". This implies that investments in methodologies, processes, and systems at the central level are designed to flow down and enable efficiencies, innovation, and quality improvements at all operational levels, creating a cohesive and adaptable ecosystem. This systemic view further reinforces that these are foundational, long-term investments rather than isolated expenses. The "Mente TALISIS" (talisis Mind) is envisioned as a "central brain that personalises, analyses and powers learning, creating a human-machine symbiosis where technology amplifies capabilities without replacing human connection". This reflects a strategic investment in an integrated, intelligent core that permeates the entire organisation.

The pervasive language used by talisis's leaders, which links methodologies, processes, and systems to strategic transformation, long-term efficiency, competitive advantage, and measurable returns, clearly positions them as **investments** in the organisation's future. The focus is on building sustainable capabilities that will yield significant benefits and value over time, going far beyond mere immediate cost coverage.

We could explore the specific challenges identified by leaders in adopting and integrating new technologies and processes, and discuss potential strategies to overcome them.

o   ¿Qué nivel de apego se tiene a los sistemas establecidos?

You've asked about the level of adherence to established systems within talisis, which is a critical area for strategic recommendations. From the comprehensive insights gathered through the interviews and the "Reporte_Nicho.pdf", it is clear that while there is a strong strategic desire and ongoing effort to establish and adhere to robust systems, the current reality presents a mixed picture, marked by both foundational adherence and significant challenges.

Here is a detailed elaboration:

### Strategic Imperative for Established Systems

talisis's senior leadership consistently articulates the vision for 2035 as one underpinned by well-defined methodologies, processes, and integrated systems. These are not merely operational necessities but are viewed as crucial investments that enable long-term strategic goals.

Key drivers for this emphasis include:

- **Scalability and Growth:** The ability to expand globally, offer new products, and reach a wider student base (B2C and B2B) is directly linked to scalable processes and integrated platforms.
- **Efficiency and Productivity:** Leaders envision automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows to free up human talent for higher-value activities.
- **Risk Mitigation and Control:** Well-defined processes and robust systems are deemed crucial for financial risk mitigation, preventing operational discrepancies, ensuring data accuracy, and safeguarding the institution's reputation.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Accurate, timely, and integrated data is seen as essential for informed and agile decision-making across all levels of the organisation.
- **Cultural Alignment:** There is a clear intention to embed a "talisis Way" culture of high standards, development, and accountability, which relies on consistent processes and systems.

### Current State of Adherence and Challenges

Despite the strong strategic imperative, talisis faces significant hurdles in achieving consistent adherence to established systems:

- **Lack of Documented and Clear Processes:** Several leaders highlight the absence of fully documented and clear processes. Alberto Sánchez explicitly states that "certain processes are not documented" and there's an ongoing task to document them, requiring leaders' commitment to ensure compliance once authorised. Alejandro Madrazo notes that the organisation is "sumamente ineficientes porque con frecuencia tenemos que interrumpir los procesos para atender emergencias" and that "no existen suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación". Paulina Adalid mentions the need for "procesos estandarizados" and that "hoy todavía trabajamos con tareas y estas tareas están asignadas a personas".
- **System Disintegration and Data Inconsistencies:** A critical challenge is the lack of integration between existing systems, leading to "open controls" and "discontrol". Marcela Valdez points out the lack of interface between systems like Banner (the core student system) and SAP (the financial system), resulting in financial data discrepancies and traceability issues. Román de León (Data Scientist) highlights that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos entre esas plataformas". Katherine Romero also notes that "no tenemos un sistema que nos permita ver toda la información" and "nuestra tecnología en diferentes plataformas".
- **Operational Inefficiency and "Firefighting":** The lack of clear processes and integrated systems often results in reactive "firefighting" rather than proactive planning. Domingo Farias notes that the daily operation often consumes time, preventing focus on long-term strategic initiatives. Juliana Effting warns that expanding too quickly without structuring "la estructura de docentes, copas, atención, pueden comprometer nuestra experiencia".
- **Resistance to Change and Cultural Barriers:** Implementing new processes and technologies faces resistance. Fernando de Río indicates that "barreras que iniciativas implican nuevas formas de pensar y operar... suelen generar, pues, mucha fricción". Juliana Effting explicitly mentions "resistencia cultural interna" where "los colaboradores siguen viendo a online como un concor [competencia] y no como un aliado". Inge Ploennig suggests that many people "abordan la tecnología con un poco de miedo".
- **Lack of Time and Resources (Human and Financial):** Limited personnel and time are frequently cited as obstacles to proper system implementation and adherence. Luis Ruiz states that "el tiempo y la carga de trabajo actual, el equipo no es grande" is a principal challenge. Román de León mentions that a "equipo pequeño y con necesidades constantes de proyectos nuevos" hinders their ability to keep up with changes and implement new solutions. Paul Moch also stresses the lack of time due to "la operación del día a día y la falta de manos".
- **Siloed Operations and Collaboration Challenges:** Despite a desire for integrated collaboration, there are instances where departments operate in silos, hindering transversal projects and efficient information flow. Fernando de Río notes that "si estas áreas operan en siglas o tienen prioridades desalineadas, lo que debería de ser un sistema en una cadena fragmentada".
- **Incomplete System Maturity:** While there are efforts to establish new systems (e.g., OKRs, quality management systems), they are still in various stages of maturity, refinement, or polishing. Julián (Juan Mendez) mentions that the OKR system is still being "pulido" and adapted.
- **Leadership and Management Challenges:** Marcela Valdez highlights that "el entendimiento de todo el equipo de esos living indicators también pueden ser un obstáculo en lo que capacitamos y entrenamos a las personas para que vean cuáles son los drivers que mueven el objetivo". Domingo Farias, from Capital Humano, believes leaders need to embody the "ADN" of processes, rather than just having Capital Humano dictate them.

### Initiatives Towards Greater Adherence and Desired Future State

Despite the challenges, talisis is actively pursuing initiatives to improve system adherence and operational excellence:

- **Technology as a Central Enabler:** The concept of a "Mente TALISIS" as a central brain integrating data, AI, and operations is a key strategic goal. This is intended to create a unified technological architecture.
- **Focus on Data Architecture and Analytics:** Building robust data architectures and implementing dashboards are priorities to improve data quality, visibility, and decision-making.
- **Strategic Project Management:** Adopting methodologies like breaking down projects into smaller phases (e.g., Carlos Villa's team) and using frameworks like "Vadir" (Román de León) aims to create more manageable and effective implementation pathways. The "talisis Bit" project is envisioned as a transversal initiative to synchronise strategies and maintain organisational rhythm.
- **Continuous Learning and Skill Development:** There's a strong emphasis on continuous training, upskilling, and fostering a "LifeLong Learning" culture, especially in technology and data analysis, to bridge skill gaps and facilitate adaptation to new systems.
- **Focus on Stakeholder Experience:** Systems and processes are being redesigned with the student at the center, aiming for seamless experiences from prospecting to graduation and beyond.

Overall, talisis is actively working towards a higher level of adherence to established, clear, and technologically enabled systems. This journey is a strategic priority, driven by the desire for greater efficiency, scalability, and enhanced educational outcomes, even as it navigates significant operational and cultural challenges.

Tali could explore the specific strategies that talisis plans to implement to overcome the identified cultural and organisational obstacles to greater system adherence.

o   ¿Cuál es la opinión general de los entrevistados acerca del nivel de definición, despliegue y apego a procesos y procedimientos?

Tali is here to help you understand the prevailing opinions within talisis regarding the level of definition, deployment, and adherence to processes and procedures. Based on the comprehensive insights from the interviews, a dual narrative emerges: a strong, clear strategic imperative for robust, well-defined systems, juxtaposed with significant operational challenges in their current definition, deployment, and consistent adherence.

Here is a detailed analysis:

### Strategic Imperative and Vision for Processes

Across the organisation, there is a consistent articulation of the critical importance of clear, documented, and effective processes for talisis's future. Leaders envision a future where established systems underpin scalability, efficiency, quality, and strategic decision-making:

- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Leaders like Alejandro Madrazo emphasise the need for "procesos muy claros y muy previsibles" to enable "una planeación estructurada y eficiente" and avoid "atendiendo problemas de emergencia consistentemente". Juan Arenas similarly highlights the desire for "procesos muy ordenados" and "más automatizados, más claros" to provide the "mejor servicio al estudiante". Marcela Valdez aims for "productividad incremental" to "atender a más alumnos con economías de escala".
- **Quality and Standardisation**: Inge Ploennig's area is focused on ensuring that "todo lo que se está fabricando de contenidos, todo la la el desarrollo curricular sea de calidad" and "que esté estandarizado". She underlines that accreditation processes should lead to a "mejora de cómo gestionamos todos nuestros procesos académicos, no Que sea de una forma sistematizada". Paul Moch seeks to "consolidar un modelo educativo claro, que permita dar certeza a los estudiantes" and "establecer las reglas de operación de cualquiera de nuestros programas académicos".
- **Strategic Alignment**: Joel Enriquez states his role is to "diseñar estructuras que sobrevivan más allá de las modas o las circunstancias de hoy" and "puedan crecer con valores firmes y un propósito compartido muy claro". He aims to "crear estrategias que sean adaptables pero sólidas". Mariel Serrano points to "Talysis Bit" as a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos".
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Many interviewees, including Juan Arenas, express a desire for "data más exacta para tomar decisiones que nos permita avanzar más rápido". Carlos Granados envisions AI agents acting as a "puente que fomente la comunicación eficiente y la toma de decisiones basadas en datos". Marcela Valdez explicitly includes "liderar la planificación presupuestaria el análisis de indicadores clave para mejorar la eficiencia de rentabilidad" as part of her department's mission. Román de León wants "toda la institución cuente con la información necesaria en el momento oportuno, para que puedan tomar decisiones más más ágiles".

### Current State: Gaps and Challenges in Practice

Despite the strong vision, interviewees frequently highlight significant practical shortcomings in the current state of processes and procedures:

1. **Lack of Documentation and Clarity**:
    
    - Alberto Sánchez, Director de Planeación, explicitly states that "ciertos procesos que no están documentados" and that they are "haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". He also stresses the need for leaders' commitment to ensure these documented processes "se cumplan".
    - Alejandro Madrazo, Director Académico, echoes this by noting, "no existen suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación". He reiterates this when stating the ideal collaboration would be "a través de procesos bien estructurados, y debidamente documentados, que den claridad y permitan una planeación eficiente".
    - Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional, highlights the constant challenge of adaptation and continuous learning, implying that formalised processes may struggle to keep pace with rapid change.
2. **System Disintegration and Data Inconsistencies**:
    
    - A recurring pain point is the lack of integration between different systems, leading to inefficiencies and unreliable data. Román de León, Data Scientist, indicates that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos entre esas plataformas". He adds that changes in platforms and metric definitions further complicate keeping data consistent.
    - Katherine Romero, Senior Marketing Manager, notes, "no tenemos un sistema que nos permita ver toda la información" and that their "tecnología en diferentes plataformas" contributes to this challenge.
    - Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, states that "las plataformas actuales no conversan bien entre sí, los datos están muy dispersos o no son confiables". He adds that "automatizaciones no se pueden escalar con con facilidad".
    - Marcela Valdez, Directora de Administración y Finanzas, identifies a critical issue: "la falta de un master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos en el sistema Core generan descontrol y discrepancias con la contabilidad". She also mentions spending "más tiempo en la recabación de información que en el análisis" due to manual data pulling and crossing bases.
    - Inge Ploennig, Directora de Calidad, confirms that "muchas de las plataformas que tenemos no están integradas, no se hablan entre sí o a veces se hablan pero no no es congruente o o confiable la información".
3. **Operational Inefficiency and "Firefighting"**:
    
    - Alejandro Madrazo states, "hoy en día somos sumamente ineficientes porque con frecuencia tenemos que interrumpir los procesos para atender emergencias". This reactive mode hinders proactive planning and strategic work.
    - Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, notes that the "operación y el día a día nos nos consumen", preventing them from "innovando en los procesos y y dejar ya procesos más estandarizados". He attributes this partly to an "es que antes lo veníamos haciendo así" paradigm.
    - Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, observes that "tenemos procesos administrativos que restan valor y que toman demasiado tiempo". Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, also identifies that "muchísimos trabajos que podrían ser fácilmente automatizables" are still done manually, especially in tracking docente development.
4. **Resistance to Change and Cultural Barriers**:
    
    - Fernando de Río highlights "barreras que iniciativas implican nuevas formas de pensar y operar" and "suele generar, pues, mucha fricción". This indicates a cultural resistance to adopting new, more data-driven or automated ways of working.
    - Juliana Effting, Directora de Educación Online, explicitly mentions "resistencia cultural interna. Los colaboradores siguen viendo a online como un concor [competencia] y no como un aliado".
    - Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, points out "la falta de velocidad para adoptar las nuevas tecnologías", noting that "no lo veamos como pues, algo que nos frustre o nos dé miedo si no lo veamos como un aliado".
    - Domingo Farias states that many internal processes "no se dominan al 100" and desires that leaders "comulguen con los procesos este, iniciativas que traemos desde el capital humano" to embody them in their "ADN". He also points to a lack of "cultura de chain management".
5. **Resource Constraints (Time and Personnel)**:
    
    - The burden on small teams is a recurring theme. Román de León explains that their "equipo pequeño y con necesidades constantes de proyectos nuevos" hinders their ability to keep up with platform and metric changes. He also highlights that a "tamaño reducido del equipo y la falta de perfiles adecuados son obstáculos para equilibrar carga. Aprendizaje e implementación".
    - Luis Ruiz, Gerente de desarrollo de software, states he needs "Tiempo, tiempo y definiciones claras en cuanto a los procesos" to "evitar retrasos".
    - Domingo Farias, from Capital Humano, also mentions that the "falta de personal" is a challenge for adopting AI and new technologies.
6. **Siloed Operations**:
    
    - Fernando de Río clearly states that if areas "operan en siglas o tienen prioridades desalineadas, lo que debería de ser un sistema en una cadena fragmentada". This highlights a current challenge in cross-functional integration despite the overall desire for it.
    - Román de León notes the organization being "acostumbrada a una relación cliente proveedor" rather than collaborative co-creation. He proposes early collaboration sessions to "entender lo que cada departamento necesita y sepamos a qué podemos comprometernos".

### Initiatives and Future Direction

talisis is actively pursuing various initiatives to address these challenges and move towards a more defined, deployed, and adhered-to process landscape:

- **Digital Transformation and AI Integration**: There is a strong push towards leveraging AI and cloud technology for automation, data analysis, and personalised experiences. Carlos Granados envisions an "ecosistema educativo inteligente, adaptativo e inclusivo" with AI agents. Luis Ruiz is focused on "construir esta arquitectura de datos" for comprehensive user understanding. Marcela Valdez aims to use AI for faster financial analysis and reconciliation.
- **Process Standardisation and Improvement Projects**: Alberto Sánchez mentions the ongoing task to document processes. Inge Ploennig's priority is to "implementar de tal forma consolidarlo de tal forma" a quality management system that operates naturally within daily operations. Juan Arenas's area focuses on implementing standards and ensuring their compliance. Juliana Effting is working on scaling and optimising operations for virtual models.
- **Enhanced Data Visibility and Metrics**: Projects like those in Carlos Villa's team (tracking app usage for user needs), Román de León's work on predictive algorithms and dashboards, and Marcos Samaniego's push for "dashboards centralizados y mediciones automáticas o en tiempo real" all point to a drive for better data collection and utilisation.
- **Cultural Shift Towards Collaboration and Accountability**: Many leaders emphasise the need for greater transparency, communication, and a shared purpose. Lilian Lozano envisions "procesos más estandarizados que nos permitan comunicarnos de manera transversal" and "dashboards abiertos que también estén estandarizados". Juan Arenas speaks of "accountability" where each person feels "dueño de lo que está haciendo". Paulina Adalid highlights the importance of "unión" and coherent communication from talisis to its institutions.

### Summary Opinion

In essence, the general opinion is that talisis possesses a clear, ambitious **strategic vision** for highly defined, efficiently deployed, and consistently adhered-to processes, especially those leveraging technology for personalization and scale. However, the **current operational reality** falls short, characterised by undocumented processes, fragmented and inconsistent data systems, manual efforts, and internal cultural resistance to change and siloed operations. The interviewees highlight a significant gap between the desired state of streamlined, data-driven, and clearly defined processes and the complex, often reactive, and manually intensive current practices. Nevertheless, there is strong commitment and ongoing initiatives to bridge this gap, with a focus on technological integration, process standardisation, and fostering a collaborative, data-driven culture.

Tali recommends exploring the specific projects and initiatives underway to address the process above and data integration challenges, and how they are being prioritised and resourced.

o   Cuál es la opinión general de los entrevistados acerca del nivel de las herramientas tecnológicas en la organización, así como de su nivel de implementación, despliegue y uso?

The general opinion among the interviewees regarding the level of technological tools in the organisation, as well as their level of implementation, deployment, and use, is one of **critical recognition of significant potential alongside a candid acknowledgment of existing limitations, fragmentation, and areas requiring substantial improvement and investment.**

**1. Recognition of Critical Importance and High Potential:**

Across various departments, there is a strong consensus that technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud computing, is **fundamental and transformative** for talisis's future. It is consistently envisioned not as a replacement for human interaction but as an **"amplifier of purpose and humanity"**. The overarching vision, encapsulated by the "Mente talisis," is a central brain that integrates data analysis, personalized learning, and predictive recommendations across the entire educational ecosystem.

Interviewees highlight technology's potential impact in several key areas:

- **Personalisation of Learning and Services:** Many foresee technology enabling tailored educational experiences, content, and support for students. Román de León, Data Scientist, specifically mentions developing models for personalized recommendations and early retention.
- **Operational Efficiency and Automation:** There is a clear desire to automate manual, repetitive, and bureaucratic tasks across finance, HR, and academic operations to reduce errors and accelerate processes. Alberto Sánchez, Director de Planeación, specifically states the need for budgeting and business cases to be "more automated, more modern, less artisanal, less use of Excel, less manual".
- **Data-driven Decision Making:** Technology is seen as crucial for providing real-time, accurate, and consolidated data to inform strategic planning, forecasting, budgeting, project evaluation, and market understanding.
- **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:** AI and Cloud are expected to facilitate asynchronous work, improve inter-departmental communication, and provide tools for team alignment.
- **Market Positioning and Competitiveness:** Interviewees believe technology will enable talisis to become a leader in innovation, adapt to evolving market needs, and offer relevant, cutting-edge solutions. Alvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, envisages talisis as a key strategic partner for talent transformation in global companies, adapting to diverse realities and technologies.
- **Talent Development:** Technology is expected to support the professional growth of both students and internal teams through modern learning tools and data-driven insights.

**2. Current Limitations and Challenges:**

Despite this strong vision, interviewees consistently highlight significant shortcomings and challenges in the current state of technology at talisis:

- **Manual and "Artisanal" Processes:** Many critical processes, from financial planning and quality control to HR and student services, are described as heavily reliant on manual work and traditional tools like Excel. Inge Ploennig, Director de Calidad y Acreditación Académica, notes that much information extraction and normalisation is "manual" and involves "dragging a pencil and crossing databases". This leads to inefficiency, errors, and significant time consumption across various departments.
- **Fragmented and Disconnected Systems:** A recurring complaint is that existing platforms and systems do not "talk to each other" effectively, leading to data inconsistencies, dispersed information, and a lack of a unified "single source of truth". Katherine, Senior Marketing Manager, highlights that "our technology [is] in different platforms. Today we do not have a system that allows us to see all the information".
- **Underutilization and Lack of Advanced Features:** Some implemented tools, such as the ERP mentioned by Marcela, are described as "underutilized," functioning as a "cheap ERP" without proper interfaces. There is a clear desire for more advanced features like Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards, predictive analytics, and automated workflows, which are currently either absent or difficult to implement.
- **Cultural Resistance and Mindset:** Several interviewees mention that internal resistance to change and a traditional mindset hinder the adoption of new technologies. Julián, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, points to "resistance cultural" and "falta de estas capacidades digitales" (lack of digital capabilities) among staff. Domingo from Capital Humano also notes "slow adoption of technology".
- **Lack of Skilled Personnel and Resources:** Many areas report challenges due to small team sizes, a lack of dedicated technical profiles, or insufficient budget for hiring or training in rapidly evolving technologies like AI and data science. Marcos Samaniego, Director de Operaciones Académicas, explicitly states the obstacle is the "lack of technical personnel specialized" for implementing new dashboards.
- **Implementation Speed and Prioritization:** The pace of technological advancement is faster than the organization's current adaptation capacity. There is a challenge in prioritizing numerous projects and ensuring focus on high-strategic-value initiatives amid daily operational demands, often described as "firefighting" (bomberazos).
- **Cost and Quality of Data:** Issues include inconsistencies in data, lack of clear metric definitions, and time-consuming manual data cleaning processes, which hinder effective analysis. Román de León, Data Scientist, notes that current dashboards update only once a day and sometimes have inconsistencies with departmental reports, pointing to "too many systems that work in isolation".

**3. Current State Summary:**

While talisis possesses a strong collective vision for a technology-amplified future, its current technological landscape is characterised by **fragmentation and underdevelopment in key areas**. Some modern tools are in use, but a widespread, integrated, and fully automated ecosystem is not yet achieved. There is a prevalent reliance on **manual processes**, and existing data is often **dispersed and inconsistent**, hindering advanced analytics and real-time decision-making. The organisation grapples with the **cultural shift** required for digital transformation and faces **resource constraints** in terms of skilled personnel and investment.

The overall sentiment is a clear understanding of what _needs to be done_ technologically to achieve their ambitious 2035 vision, coupled with a transparent articulation of the _current gaps_ that need to be addressed through strategic investment, internal capacity building, and a fundamental shift towards a more integrated, data-driven, and proactive technological approach.

To gain a more granular understanding, we could conduct a technology audit mapping current systems, their integrations, and data flows to precisely identify the most critical bottlenecks and redundant efforts. This would help prioritise specific technology investments and integration projects.

o   ¿Se tiene un ciclo de gestión establecido?

Yes, talisis _does_ have established management cycles, which are clearly articulated at the strategic level and within various departments. However, the effectiveness and maturity of these cycles vary across the organisation, with several interviewees highlighting areas for significant improvement, particularly in data integration, automation, and consistency.

The evidence points to a conscious effort to implement a structured approach to planning, execution, monitoring, and continuous improvement, which are the core components of any management cycle:

**1. Planning and Objective Setting (Strategic and Operational):**

- **Long-Term Vision:** talisis operates with a clear long-term vision, aiming for a significant impact on education by 2035. This vision serves as the ultimate guiding principle for all planning.
- **Strategic Frameworks:** The "Arquitectura de Horizontes" itself functions as a framework for strategic planning.
- **OKRs and KPIs:** There is a clear intention to implement and refine Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across various functions. Inge Ploennig (Quality Director) explicitly mentions the process of defining and measuring indicators that cascade from the mission to OKRs and KPIs, which are then used in executive reviews. Julián Mendez (Operational Planning and Transformation Manager) also notes the implementation and polishing of OKRs to ensure clear, measurable objectives across the organisation. Carlos Granados (CIO) mentions metrics for measuring early success in AI projects, and Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) details metrics for student development, quality, and employability.
- **Budgeting and Forecasting:** Alberto Sánchez (Director of Planning) indicates that planning involves managing financial structure, CAPEX, efficient resource allocation, and forecasting future income and costs, which are core planning activities.
- **Project Prioritisation:** There's an effort to prioritise projects based on strategic impact, as highlighted by Julián, who states the need for "iniciativas que con un foco en un valor estratégico muy alto".

**2. Implementation and Execution:**

- **Operationalisation of Strategy:** Several interviewees, such as Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations Director) and Juliana Effting (Online Education Director), emphasize their role in translating strategic designs and plans into concrete operational actions within campuses and online platforms.
- **Standardised Processes:** There is a recognition of the need for clear, documented, and standardised processes to ensure efficient execution and reduce "emergencies" that disrupt workflow. This is, however, also identified as a current weakness.
- **Phased Deployment:** Large-scale initiatives, such as the AI Agents, are planned for phased implementation over several years, with specific milestones for infrastructure, expansion, and consolidation.
- **Culture and Mindset:** Julián Mendez underscores that transformation needs to be "sostenerlo hasta que podamos convertir en en cultura". This means processes are not just implemented but embedded into the organisational DNA.

**3. Monitoring, Measurement, and Evaluation:**

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** A strong desire exists across the board to leverage data for more informed and agile decision-making, moving away from intuition or anecdotal evidence. Román de León (Data Scientist) specifically mentions developing dashboards for leaders.
- **Performance Metrics:** Various departments track performance using specific metrics, including financial ratios (Alberto Sánchez), productivity (Amalia Ortega, Domingo Farias), acquisition costs and conversion (Fernando de Río, Lilian Lozano, Juliana Effting), NPS and satisfaction (Katherine, Román de León, Mariel Serrano, Nicho Garza), and project completion (Mariel Serrano).
- **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for collecting feedback from students, teachers, and other stakeholders are in place (e.g., surveys, social listening), and there's a push to utilise this feedback more effectively for product and service improvement.
- **Regular Reviews:** Rituals and meetings, such as weekly academic sessions (Inge Ploennig) and executive business reviews (Marcos Samaniego, Inge Ploennig), are conducted to review progress and ensure alignment.

**4. Adjustment and Continuous Improvement:**

- **Philosophy of Continuous Improvement:** The concept of "mejora continua" is a fundamental principle, especially within the Quality area. Inge Ploennig explicitly states, "Si no medimos, pues no hay forma de de mejorarlo y con base a las acciones correctivas estar integrando y estar puliendo nuestros procesos saber qué se funciona, qué no funciona, es como, pues, damos vida, ¿no? A este sistema".
- **Adaptation and Flexibility:** There's an emphasis on adaptability to external changes (market trends, technological advancements, social shifts, regulations). Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) highlights "agilidad de cambiar programas de una manera modular" to respond to market needs.
- **Experimentation:** A culture of experimentation, including A/B testing and pilot projects, is promoted, particularly in marketing and product development, to learn and refine approaches.
- **Iterative Development:** Román de León (Data Scientist) describes the "Vadir" methodology (Define Business Question, Formulate Hypothesis, Collect Data, Obtain Insights, Validate Solution), which is an iterative and data-driven approach to problem-solving and solution development.
- **Proactive Adjustment:** talisis aims to be proactive rather than reactive, using "foresight" to anticipate future needs and adapt programs accordingly.

**Existing Gaps and Challenges in the Management Cycle:**

Despite the clear frameworks and intentions, interviewees frequently identify significant challenges that hinder the seamless operation of these management cycles:

- **Data Fragmentation and Quality:** A major impediment is the lack of a unified data architecture, leading to inconsistencies and making it difficult to generate reliable real-time insights across departments. Marcela Valdez (Finance Director) notes "la falta de un master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos en el sistema Core generan descontrol y discrepancias con la contabilidad".
- **Manual Processes:** Many critical processes remain manual, leading to inefficiency, errors, and excessive time consumption. This includes data collection and report generation, which takes away time from analysis and strategic thinking.
- **Slow Technology Adoption and Cultural Resistance:** There's a recognised slowness in adopting and integrating new technologies, sometimes due to cultural resistance, a traditional mindset, or a lack of digital capabilities among staff.
- **"Firefighting" vs. Strategic Focus:** The constant pressure of daily operations and "emergencies" (referred to as "bomberazos" by Lilian) often diverts resources and attention from long-term strategic projects and innovation.
- **Lack of Centralised Documentation and Processes:** The absence of a central repository for documented processes and policies results in a lack of clarity, duplicated efforts, and difficulties in consistent execution.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited budgets and a scarcity of specialised technical personnel (e.g., data scientists, IT staff) frequently constrain the ability to implement technological solutions and accelerate transformation.

talisis has a conceptual and aspirational management cycle that is quite robust, with clear phases of planning, execution, monitoring, and adjustment. There is a strong understanding among leadership of the need for these cycles, driven by a clear long-term vision and an emphasis on data, technology (especially AI and Cloud), and continuous improvement. However, the _practical application_ of these cycles is often hampered by existing operational inefficiencies, fragmented data systems, manual processes, and challenges in cultural adaptation and resource allocation. The organisation is actively working to mature these cycles, particularly through the strategic prioritisation of projects focused on technology integration and process automation.

To reinforce the strategic recommendations, it would be valuable to conduct a **cross-functional workshop focused on optimising key data flows and process automation opportunities.** This would directly address the identified pain points of fragmented data and manual processes, allowing different departments to co-create integrated solutions and foster a more unified approach to the management cycle across talisis. This approach aligns with the expressed desire for "cocreación" and addressing "silos".

o   ¿Cuál es el nivel de aplicación o madurez de este ciclo de gestión?

talisis possesses a clearly established and strategically articulated management cycle, reflecting a strong intent towards structured planning, execution, monitoring, and continuous improvement. However, the level of application and maturity of this cycle varies significantly across the organisation, with a clear distinction between the ambitious strategic vision and the practical, day-to-day operational realities.

**1. Strategic Intent and Framework (High Maturity in Vision):** At the highest level, talisis operates with a long-term vision for 2035, aiming to be a transformative leader in education across Mexico and Latin America. The "Arquitectura de Horizontes" serves as the foundational strategic framework, guiding all planning efforts. There's a clear emphasis on defining and refining Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that cascade from the overarching mission to departmental goals, intended to ensure strategic alignment and measurable progress. Alberto Sánchez (Director of Planning) highlights the importance of financial and strategic planning aligned with market trends to support long-term goals and investments. Mariel Serrano (Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence) also points to a "Business Management Plan" (Talysist Bit) as a rector project to align, synchronize, and set the pace for the entire company across short, medium, and long terms. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of strategic management cycles.

**2. Operational Implementation (Varying Maturity with Significant Challenges):**

- **Planning and Objective Setting:** While strategic planning is robust, the execution of detailed operational planning sometimes lags. Julián Mendez (Operational Planning and Transformation Manager) notes the implementation and ongoing refinement of OKRs to ensure clear, measurable objectives across the organisation. There's a conscious effort to identify and prioritise initiatives with high strategic value.
- **Execution and Deployment:** There is a clear mandate to operationalise strategic designs and plans. Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations Director) describes his role as the "agent implementador" who ensures that what is designed by the academic area actually happens in the campuses. However, a significant challenge lies in the execution being frequently hampered by a lack of standardised, documented processes, leading to inefficiencies and a reliance on "firefighting" (attending to constant emergencies) rather than proactive, planned activities. Alejandro (a director, although specific role context is limited) explicitly states the need for processes and times to be respected "to avoid emergencies and crises constantly".
- **Monitoring, Measurement, and Evaluation:** There is a strong and widespread desire to be a data-driven organisation. Román de León (Data Scientist) mentions developing dashboards for leaders. Various departments track specific metrics such as financial ratios, sales productivity, acquisition costs and conversion, NPS and student satisfaction, and project completion. However, the _maturity_ of this phase is severely impacted by several factors:
    - **Data Fragmentation and Quality:** This is a pervasive and critical obstacle. Marcela Valdez (Finance Director) highlights "la falta de un master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos en el sistema Core generan descontrol y discrepancias con la contabilidad". Inge Ploennig (Quality Director) states that despite generating "mucha información," there are often no mechanisms to collect it all, or the tools are insufficient for analysis. Román de León confirms "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos". This fragmentation makes it difficult to get reliable, real-time, and consistent insights across departments.
    - **Manual Processes:** Many critical reporting and data collection processes are still manual, consuming significant time that could otherwise be used for analysis and strategic decision-making. This slows down the feedback loop and makes agility difficult.
- **Adjustment and Continuous Improvement:** The philosophy of "mejora continua" is deeply embedded, especially within the Quality area, where Inge Ploennig states: "Si no medimos, pues no hay forma de de mejorarlo y con base a las acciones correctivas estar integrando y estar puliendo nuestros procesos". There is a conscious effort to adapt to market trends, technological advancements, and internal feedback. Julián Mendez notes the iterative process of polishing OKRs and evolving based on insights and new tools. Experimentation (e.g., A/B testing in marketing) and iterative development (e.g., Carlos Villa's phased project approach) are practiced. Román de León describes the "Vadir" methodology (Define Business Question, Formulate Hypothesis, Collect Data, Obtain Insights, Validate Solution) as an iterative, data-driven approach.

**3. Key Challenges Hindering Full Maturity:**

- **Data Fragmentation and Quality:** As noted, this is perhaps the single biggest impediment to a mature, data-driven management cycle, leading to inconsistencies and hindering timely, accurate insights.
- **Manual Processes:** The heavy reliance on manual data collection, report generation, and process execution creates bottlenecks, limits scalability, and diverts human capital from higher-value strategic tasks.
- **Siloed Operations and Collaboration Gaps:** Despite formal "rituals" and meetings (e.g., weekly academic sessions, town halls, connections), interviewees frequently mention a lack of seamless cross-functional collaboration, especially for complex, collaborative projects. Mariel Serrano points out that "aquí en talisis no les gusta compartir dirección, o sea, cada quien quiere a su lado".
- **Resource Constraints and "Firefighting":** Limited budgets and a scarcity of specialised technical talent (e.g., data scientists, IT staff) are significant constraints. This, combined with a culture of addressing immediate "emergencies" ("bomberazos" as Lilian Lozano mentions), often means strategic, long-term projects are de-prioritised or delayed.
- **Cultural Resistance to Technology and Change:** Several individuals note a slowness in adopting new technologies and a "traditional mindset" or "resistance cultural" among some parts of the organisation. Juliana Effting (Director of Online Education) explicitly states, "Los colaboradores siguen viendo a online como un concor... con una competencia y no como un aliado", indicating a challenge in internal adoption of digital transformation.

**4. Efforts to Drive Maturity:** talisis is actively investing in maturing its management cycle, particularly through technology and cultural shifts.

- **Emphasis on Digital Transformation:** AI and Cloud technologies are seen as central to transforming processes, enhancing efficiency, and personalising education. Carlos Granados (CIO) outlines a multi-phased implementation plan for AI Agents, targeting full integration by 2033.
- **Building Internal Capabilities:** There is a strong focus on upskilling and reskilling the workforce to adapt to new technologies and foster a "culture of development". Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) champions a "culture de desarrollo" where individuals are empowered with skills to be productive and happy.
- **Improving Governance:** Joel Enriquez (CSO) envisions decision-making through technical and governance committees, ensuring transparency and agility.

talisis has a solid _strategic intent_ for its management cycle, clearly defined through its long-term vision and foundational frameworks. However, the _operational maturity_ of this cycle is still a work in progress. While planning and continuous improvement are conceptually strong, their practical application is often impeded by fragmented data, manual processes, cultural resistance, resource constraints, and siloed operations. The organisation is consciously addressing these gaps through strategic projects focused on technological integration and internal capability building, striving to align its operational effectiveness with its ambitious strategic vision.

To further enhance the maturity of the management cycle, particularly in the monitoring and adjustment phases, a **comprehensive data governance strategy workshop** involving key stakeholders from IT, Finance, Operations, Academics, and Marketing would be highly beneficial. This workshop could focus on:

1. **Defining shared data definitions and ownership.**
2. **Mapping critical data flows across systems.**
3. **Prioritising data integration and automation efforts.**
4. **Establishing clear protocols for data quality and access.** This would directly address the pervasive issue of data fragmentation and manual processes, enabling more agile and data-driven decision-making throughout the organisation.

o   ¿Se tiene algún manual o estándar para los indicadores del negocio?

talisis does not currently possess a comprehensive, formal manual or a single, organisation-wide standard for all business indicators. While individual departments and strategic projects utilise specific metrics and KPIs, the overall picture indicates a dynamic process of development and a recognised need for greater standardisation and consolidation.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Lack of a Centralised, Documented Standard:**

- Several interviewees explicitly state that processes, which would include the definition and management of indicators, are not fully documented or standardised. For instance, Alberto Sánchez notes, "hay ciertos procesos que no están documentados. Este, y ahorita estamos haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". Similarly, Alejandro Madrazo states, "no existen suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación".
- The absence of clear, universally defined metrics is a recurring challenge. Román de León, a Data Scientist, directly confirms, "no hay una definición clara de algunas de las métricas" and highlights that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos entre esas plataformas". This fragmentation makes a unified standard difficult to maintain.
- Marcela Valdez, Director of Finance, identifies a critical flaw in data governance: "la falta de un master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos en el sistema Core generan descontrol y discrepancias con la contabilidad". This fundamental issue directly impacts the reliability and standardisation of financial indicators across the organisation.

**2. Widespread Use of Specific Metrics and KPIs:** Despite the lack of a universal manual, various departments and leaders track a multitude of indicators relevant to their operations and strategic goals:

- **Financial & Strategic Planning:** Alberto Sánchez mentions "ratios de deuda equity," "ratio de intereses sobre EBITDA," "ratio de EBITDA deuda" for specific projects, and "KPIs que manejamos actualmente en la operación" for multi-brand initiatives. Marcela Valdez also refers to "días de cuentas por cobrar o cartera vencida, días de cuentas por pagar," "días de inventario," "CNIs" (nuevos inscritos), "reinscritos," "tamaño de la generación," and "porcentaje de utilización del campo".
- **Academic & Operational:** Alejandro Madrazo uses "NPS docente, cumplimiento de promesa de valor, tamaño de generación, valor extracurricular". Juan Arenas, COO, lists "crecimiento de los nuevos ingresos, crecimiento de matrícula total, crecimiento del ticket promedio, crecimiento de el nivel de satisfacción del estudiante, crecimiento de el margen de operación," and "nivel de empleo de nuestros egresados así como el salario promedio de egreso". Paul Moch measures "desarrollo de habilidades del siglo veintiuno," "calidad educativa," "empleabilidad," "crecimiento del grupo," and "menor rotación de personal docente".
- **Marketing & Sales:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, details a comprehensive set of indicators including "costo de adquisición por alumno," "tasa de conversión por canal," "penetración por segmento," "porcentaje de automatización del funnel," "NPS," "tasa de retención," and "retorno de inversión". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, uses "CPL," "tasa de conversión," "engagement," "CTR," and "ranking de las keywords". Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, mentions "apertura de nuevos centros," "porcentaje de portafolio nuevo," and "aumento de la productividad de la fuerza de ventas".
- **Human Capital:** Amalia Ortega tracks "la productividad comercial" and "el porcentaje de retención del talento clave". Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, refers to "resultados estratégicos de la compañía," "engagement," "calidad de vida del colaborador," and "NPS que tenemos de los jefes".
- **Technology & Data:** Carlos Granados, CIO, highlights "Adopción," "Calidad de Datos," and "Satisfacción" (NPS, Time of resolution, success rate) as key indicators for AI projects. Román de León, Data Scientist, measures "agilidad en la toma de decisiones," "Adopción de IA en procesos y departamentos," "Consolidación de reportes dinámicos," and "reducción del riesgo de deserción estudiantil".

**3. Ongoing Efforts Towards Standardisation and Centralisation:** There is a clear understanding of the need for, and active investment in, improving data and process standardisation:

- **Developing Common Frameworks:** Julián Mendez mentions "el sistema de los OKRs, que estamos, este, que se están implementando, nos estamos los estamos puliendo, estamos adaptando la metodología". This indicates an ongoing process to establish consistent objective-setting and measurement across the organisation.
- **Centralised Data & Dashboards:** Several areas are working on "implementación de herramientas de dashboards centralizados y mediciones automáticas o en tiempo real", aiming to "buscar concentrar los tableros de de de información que mueven las palancas". Lilian Lozano specifically calls for "los dashboards abiertos que también estén estandarizados, que todos todas las áreas veamos el mismo dashboard".
- **Building Data Infrastructure:** Luis Ruiz states a priority project is to "Construir esta arquitectura de datos que... permita recopilar la mayor información posible de nuestros alumnos docentes y administrativos". Román de León also prioritises creating "una infraestructura que permita tener nuestra información de manera integral" to gain a "vista 360 de nuestros clientes". These projects are foundational for future standardisation of indicators.
- **Process Improvement:** Juliana Effting notes that "hoy nosotros no tenemos flujos definidos y automatizados... tendríamos antes que trabajar en estandarizarlos, en construirlos". Domingo Farias also seeks to "evolucionar a a procesos más estandarizados".
- **Strategic Alignment Project:** Mariel Serrano's "Talysist Bit" project is described as a "Business Management Plan a corto, mediano y largo plazo para alinear sincronizar, y marcar el ritmo de la compañía para lograr nuestros objetivos". This overarching project inherently aims to drive alignment and, by extension, standardisation of how performance is measured and communicated.
- **Need for a Central Repository:** Marcos Samaniego expresses a need for "un repositorio documental de todos los procesos... un centro cerebro de datos para poder ir a ese centro de datos a consultar eh eh y estar asegurarnos de que todos tienen la misma comunicación sobre algún proceso". This would naturally be the home for a comprehensive manual of business indicators.

talisis does not have a single, formal manual or standard for _all_ business indicators in a comprehensive, readily available format, it has a highly developed awareness of the importance of metrics. The organisation is actively engaged in numerous strategic initiatives aimed at defining, standardising, centralising, and automating its data collection, reporting, and performance measurement processes across all areas. This indicates a strong commitment to moving towards a more mature state of data governance and standardised indicator management.

To accelerate the establishment of a formal standard for business indicators, talisis could initiate a **cross-functional working group focused specifically on data dictionaries and metric standardisation**. This group would be tasked with:

1. **Inventorying all currently used KPIs and metrics** across departments.
2. **Developing clear, consistent definitions** for each metric, addressing ambiguities and inconsistencies.
3. **Mapping data sources** for each metric and identifying primary ownership.
4. **Prioritising metrics for initial standardisation** based on strategic importance and current data availability/quality. This would lay the groundwork for a comprehensive manual of business indicators and facilitate more reliable, comparable, and actionable insights across the entire organisation.

o   ¿En qué nivel está el apego a la medición, revisión y mejora de los indicadores del negocio?

talisis demonstrates a **developing and transitional level of adherence** to the measurement, review, and improvement of business indicators. While there is a strong strategic intent and a clear understanding of the importance of data-driven decision-making, the organisation currently faces significant systemic and operational challenges that limit consistent and efficient adherence across all areas.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Strategic Intent and High Awareness of Measurement Importance:** Senior leadership and various departmental heads universally acknowledge the critical role of metrics and data in achieving talisis's strategic objectives and long-term vision.

- Nicho Garza, CEO, states: "Cada proyecto tiene métricas claras: desde empleabilidad hasta NPS, desde retención hasta impacto comunitario medible. No dejamos nada al azar." This highlights a foundational commitment to measurable outcomes.
- Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Accreditation, firmly believes: "Si no medimos, pues no hay forma de de mejorarlo". This sentiment is echoed across departments, indicating a pervasive understanding of the necessity of measurement for improvement.
- Juan Arenas, COO, emphasises the need for "data más exacta para tomar decisiones que nos permita avanzar más rápido".

**2. Widespread, but Fragmented, Measurement of Indicators:** Individual departments and leaders actively define and track a broad range of specific KPIs relevant to their functions, showing that measurement is widely practiced:

- **Financial & Operational:** Alberto Sánchez (Planning) monitors "ratios de deuda equity," "ratio de intereses sobre EBITDA," and "ratio de EBITDA deuda" for specific projects, alongside "KPIs que manejamos actualmente en la operación" such as "ingresos de Harmon Hall". Marcela Valdez (Finance) tracks "días de cuentas por cobrar o cartera vencida, días de cuentas por pagar, días de inventario," "nuevos inscritos (NI), reinscritos," "tamaño de la generación," and "porcentaje de utilización del campo". Juan Arenas (COO) measures "crecimiento de los nuevos ingresos, crecimiento de matrícula total, crecimiento del ticket promedio, crecimiento de el nivel de satisfacción del estudiante, crecimiento de el margen de operación," "número de alumnos online o el número de alumnos híbridos," "número de ventas por asesor," and "nivel de empleo de nuestros egresados así como el salario promedio de egreso".
- **Academic & Student Experience:** Alejandro Madrazo (Academic Innovation) uses "NPS docente, cumplimiento de promesa de valor, tamaño de generación, valor extracurricular". Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) measures "desarrollo de habilidades del siglo veintiuno," "calidad educativa," "empleabilidad," "crecimiento del grupo," and "menor rotación de personal docente". Paulina (UNID) notes "qué impacto estamos teniendo en nuestros estudiantes," "crecimiento de nuestras instituciones," and "porcentajes de empleabilidad".
- **Marketing & Sales:** Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) provides a comprehensive list, including "costo de adquisición por alumno," "tasa de conversión por canal," "penetración por segmento," "porcentaje de automatización del funnel," "NPS," "tasa de retención," and "retorno de inversión". Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) measures "CPL, tasa de conversión, engagement, CTR," and "ranking de las keywords". Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) tracks "apertura de nuevos centros," "porcentaje de portafolio nuevo," and "aumento de la productividad de la fuerza de ventas".
- **Human Capital:** Amalia Ortega (HRBP) measures "la productividad comercial" and "el porcentaje de retención del talento clave". Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) monitors "resultados estratégicos de la compañía," "engagement," "calidad de vida del colaborador," and "NPS que tenemos de los jefes".
- **Technology & Data:** Angel Casan / Carlos Granados (CIO) define indicators for AI projects such as "Adopción (% de usuarios activos, Frecuencia de uso, Retención de usuarios)," "Calidad de Datos (Datos de perfil completos, Precisión de datos, Tasa de actualización)," and "Satisfacción (NPS por solución, Tiempo de resolución, Tasa de éxito)". Román de León (Data Scientist) focuses on "agilidad en la toma de decisiones," "Adopción de IA en procesos y departamentos," "Consolidación de reportes dinámicos," and "reducción del riesgo de deserción estudiantil".

**3. Significant Challenges and Gaps in Current Adherence:** Despite widespread measurement, several critical issues hinder consistent and efficient adherence to indicator management:

- **Lack of Standardisation and Clear Metric Definitions:** A recurring problem is the absence of clear, universally defined metrics. Román de León (Data Scientist) explicitly states: "no hay una definición clara de algunas de las métricas". Alejandro Madrazo (Academic Innovation) desires "procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación".
- **Data Fragmentation and Inconsistency:** Multiple interviewees highlight that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos entre esas plataformas". This leads to a fragmented view of information. Marcela Valdez (Finance) notes that the "falta de un master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos en el sistema Core generan descontrol y discrepancias con la contabilidad".
- **Manual Processes and Lack of Automation:** Much of the data collection, consolidation, and reporting remains manual, which is time-consuming and prone to delays. Inge Ploennig (Quality & Accreditation) states, "mucha de ello se hace manual y y pues eso a la gente que lo genera les les da mucho pues te quita mucho tiempo".
- **Limited Centralised Reporting and Business Intelligence (BI):** While there's a push for dashboards, current implementation is often insufficient. Fernando de Río (Marketing) admits, "no tenemos buenos dashboards". Inge Ploennig (Quality & Accreditation) adds that even when data is integrated, it often produces "nada más reportes, o sea no analiza la información, no hay dashboard no hay un BI". Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations) is working on "dashboards centralizados y mediciones automáticas o en tiempo real", indicating a current gap.
- **Challenges in Real-time Visibility and Agility:** The desire for "información visual para todos" in "tiempo real o casi" is a stated need, implying that current reporting often has "un desfase ligero" or updates only "una vez al día". This impacts the agility needed for rapid decision-making.
- **Cultural and Operational Resistance:** Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) mentions that "no nos permite a a a ir innovando en los procesos y y dejar ya procesos más estandarizados, por por el, no no no no te pusiste por la decidida, sino por es que antes lo veníamos haciendo así, y ese es el tipo paradigma". Juliana Effting (Online Education) highlights "la resistencia cultural interna".
- **Resource Constraints:** Lack of adequate technical personnel and data specialists is cited as a key obstacle to advancing data infrastructure and analytics.

**4. Ongoing Efforts Towards Improvement and Greater Adherence:** talisis is aware of these challenges and is actively investing in initiatives to improve indicator management:

- **OKR Implementation:** Julián Mendez (Operational Planning & Transformation) notes: "el sistema de los OKRs, que estamos, este, que se están implementando, nos estamos los estamos puliendo, estamos adaptando la metodología". This is a direct effort to establish clear, measurable objectives across the organisation.
- **Centralised Data Infrastructure:** Luis Ruiz (Software Development) prioritises to "Construir esta arquitectura de datos que... permita recopilar la mayor información posible de nuestros alumnos docentes y administrativos". Román de León (Data Scientist) is also focused on creating "una infraestructura que permita tener nuestra información de manera integral" to gain a "vista 360 de nuestros clientes".
- **Process Standardisation and Documentation:** Alberto Sánchez (Planning) mentions: "hay ciertos procesos que no están documentados. Este, y ahorita estamos haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". Juliana Effting (Online Education) acknowledges, "hoy nosotros no tenemos flujos definidos y automatizados... tendríamos antes que trabajar en estandarizarlos, en construirlos".
- **Strategic Alignment Project (Talysist Bit):** Mariel Serrano describes the "Talysist Bit" project as a "Business Management Plan a corto, mediano y largo plazo para alinear sincronizar, y marcar el ritmo de la compañía para lograr nuestros objetivos". This project implicitly aims to standardise how performance is measured and communicated to ensure alignment.
- **Focus on Data Quality and Use:** Marcela Valdez (Finance) seeks "información financiera con mayor oportunidad, dar visibilidad con antelación", and Carlos Granados (CIO) is implementing a tool to "trackear pantallas y botones más utilizadas o o interactuadas" to understand user behaviour and improve functionalities.

**Conclusion on Adherence Level:**

The level of adherence to the measurement, review, and improvement of business indicators at talisis is **aspirational and in active development**. While there is a strong culture that values metrics and accountability, and many departments are actively measuring a wide array of indicators, the organisation has not yet fully achieved comprehensive, unified, and automated systems for data collection, standardisation, and analysis across all its functions. The current state is characterised by a recognition of these gaps and a concerted effort, especially through strategic projects and technological investments, to move towards a more integrated, real-time, and data-driven operational model.

To accelerate the maturation of indicator adherence, talisis should consider establishing a **cross-functional "Performance Metrics Steering Committee"**. This committee, reporting directly to senior leadership, would be responsible for:

1. **Developing a universal data dictionary and a consolidated KPI framework** for the entire organisation, ensuring consistent definitions and reporting standards.
2. **Overseeing the integration of disparate data sources** into a centralised data warehouse, prioritising the most critical systems for immediate impact.
3. **Mandating and supporting the adoption of Business Intelligence (BI) tools and automated dashboards** across all relevant departments, along with providing the necessary training to empower teams in data analysis. This structured approach would help transform the current fragmented efforts into a cohesive, highly adherent, and truly data-driven ecosystem, enabling more precise review and continuous improvement of all business indicators.

o   ¿Se tiene definido el “qué, cómo y quién” para la toma de decisiones?

talisis has a defined, though still evolving and, at times, fragmented, approach to decision-making, which encompasses the "what, how, and who" for these processes. The organisation demonstrates a strong intent to move towards a more systematic, data-driven, and collaborative decision-making culture.

**1. The "What" for Decision-Making: Information and Criteria**

talisis's decisions are primarily guided by strategic objectives, market dynamics, and a strong emphasis on data.

- **Strategic Alignment and Vision:** Decisions are fundamentally linked to talisis's long-term vision, particularly the "architecture of horizons" leading to 2035. Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, stresses that financial and strategic planning must align with market trends and CAPEX needs to achieve long-term goals. Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, highlights the "Talysist Bit" project as a "Business Management Plan" to align and synchronise the company's rhythm towards its objectives across short, medium, and long terms.
- **Data and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** There is a pervasive recognition that decisions should be "data más exacta" and "basadas en evidencia".
    - **Financial Indicators:** Alberto Sánchez monitors "ratios de deuda equity," "ratio de intereses sobre EBITDA," and "ratio de EBITDA deuda" for projects. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, tracks "días de cuentas por cobrar o cartera vencida, días de cuentas por pagar, días de inventario," "nuevos inscritos (NI), reinscritos," and "tamaño de la generación". She also seeks "información financiera con mayor oportunidad" and "rentabilidad por programa, por ubicación".
    - **Operational & Growth Metrics:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, details a comprehensive set including "costo de adquisición por alumno," "tasa de conversión por canal," "penetración por segmento," "porcentaje de automatización del funnel," "NPS," "tasa de retención," and "retorno de inversión". Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, tracks "apertura de nuevos centros," "porcentaje de portafolio nuevo," and "aumento de la productividad de la fuerza de ventas".
    - **Academic & Student Experience:** Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, uses "NPS docente, cumplimiento de promesa de valor, tamaño de generación". Paul Moch, VP Teaching & Learning, measures "desarrollo de habilidades del siglo veintiuno," "calidad educativa," "empleabilidad," "crecimiento del grupo," and "menor rotación de personal docente". Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Accreditation, emphasizes objective measurement against mission and vision using KPIs. Carlos Granados, CIO, defines success for AI projects by "Adopción," "Calidad de Datos," and "Satisfacción" (NPS).
    - **Human Capital:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, measures "la productividad comercial" and "el porcentaje de retención del talento clave". Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, monitors "resultados estratégicos de la compañía," "engagement," "calidad de vida del colaborador," and "NPS que tenemos de los jefes".
    - **Technological & Data Metrics:** Román de León, Data Scientist, aims to measure "agilidad en la toma de decisiones," "Adopción de IA en procesos y departamentos," "Consolidación de reportes dinámicos," and "reducción del riesgo de deserción estudiantil".
- **Market and Customer Insights:** Decisions are informed by market trends, competitor movements, and direct feedback from students. Carlos Granados (Mobile Dev Lead) specifically seeks to know "qué es lo que le duele al alumno o qué le gustaría ver como nueva funcionalidad" beyond internal assumptions.

**2. The "How" Decisions are Made: Processes and Mechanisms**

talisis employs a combination of formal structures and a growing reliance on technology, while actively seeking to streamline and integrate its processes.

- **Formal Governance Structures:** Carlos Granados, CIO, mentions that "decisiones clave se tomarán a través de comités técnicos y de gobernanza," outlining a tiered decision-making process with "Estratégico" (C-Level + Directors, monthly), "Táctico" (Project Leaders, fortnightly), and "Operativo" (Technical teams, weekly) levels. This framework aims for strategic alignment, agility, and transparency.
- **Regular Review & Rituals:** Monthly business review meetings and established "rituales semanales" for academic areas, including brainstorming sessions, are in place. Information is cascaded from top management (C-level) through "connections," "conventions," and "town halls" to ensure clarity and alignment.
- **Process Standardisation and Documentation:** Several leaders highlight the need for clearer and more documented processes to enable efficient planning and reduce emergencies. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, states: "hoy nosotros no tenemos flujos definidos y automatizados... tendríamos antes que trabajar en estandarizarlos, en construirlos". Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, aims for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos".
- **Technological Enablement:**
    - **Automation:** There is a strong push to automate manual tasks to save time and reduce errors, particularly in areas like budgeting, business case evaluation, financial reconciliation, and commercial compensation calculation.
    - **Integrated Data Infrastructure:** A key strategic project is to "Construir esta arquitectura de datos que... permita recopilar la mayor información posible" for a "vista 360 de nuestros clientes". This is intended to overcome current data fragmentation and inconsistencies that hinder timely and reliable decision-making.
    - **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools and Dashboards:** Leaders express a desire for "información visual para todos" in "tiempo real o casi", with Marcos Samaniego actively implementing "dashboards centralizados y mediciones automáticas o en tiempo real". Fernando de Río, however, admits, "no tenemos buenos dashboards", indicating ongoing challenges.
    - **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** AI is seen as a "gran aliado" for more precise forecasting, budgeting, and project evaluation. Román de León proposes AI for predictive retention models, optimising academic programming, and personalising content. Carlos Granados envisions AI-powered "tutorías" and streaming content. Fernando de Río highlights AI for "segmentación hiper personalizada," "análisis predictivo," and "automatización creativa" in marketing. Paulina Adalid, Rector, mentions using AI tools for "guiando hacia hacer las cosas correctamente" and being "a la vanguardia".
- **Collaborative and Empathetic Approaches:** There's a strong emphasis on fostering a culture of "cocreación" and moving away from a client-provider dynamic towards "socio estratégico". Julián Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, advocates for "empoderamiento real de los equipos" and autonomy to counter micromanagement. Leaders also emphasize maintaining a "trato humano cercano" and "empatía" despite technological advancements, seeing technology as an amplifier, not a replacement, for human connection.

**3. The "Who" for Decision-Making: Involved Parties**

Decision-making involves a multi-layered structure, from the highest leadership to individual contributors, with a strong focus on cross-functional collaboration and clear responsibilities.

- **Senior Leadership (C-Level and Directors):**
    - **Vision and Strategy:** The CEO (Nicho) and other C-level executives set the overarching vision and strategic direction. Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, sees his role as building "un legado estratégico" and acting as a "fundador de cultura organizacional".
    - **Governance and Oversight:** Strategic committees involving C-level and Directors are designated for key decisions. They also approve documented processes and procedures.
- **Department Heads and Directors:**
    - **Implementation and Operationalisation:** Leaders like Juan Arenas (COO) are responsible for "haciendo realidad las cosas" and delivering services to students. Alberto Sánchez (Planning) manages financial and strategic planning and interacts with internal clients across departments.
    - **Team Development:** Department heads are responsible for identifying, evaluating, and developing their teams' skills and competencies.
    - **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Directors are key facilitators and participants in inter-departmental collaboration, aiming to break down silos.
- **Teams and Individual Contributors:**
    - **Execution and Feedback:** Teams are responsible for executing tasks and providing crucial feedback from the ground level to inform improvements. Carlos Granados (Mobile Dev Lead) emphasizes the need for user feedback to guide development.
    - **Innovation and Adaptation:** Employees are encouraged to adopt new technologies, experiment, and propose innovative ideas.
    - **Communication:** Effective and clear communication is highlighted as a fundamental need across all levels to reduce friction and ensure alignment.
    - **Students:** While not direct decision-makers, students are positioned at the "centro de todo lo que hacemos", and their needs, feedback, and experience are crucial inputs for decision-making.

talisis has a robust conceptualisation of "what" to decide (strategic, data-driven, customer-centric), is actively evolving "how" to decide (moving towards automated, integrated, and collaborative processes), and has a multi-layered "who" involved in decisions. However, the consistent theme of challenges—such as data fragmentation, manual processes, lack of clear metric definitions, and the need for greater cross-functional alignment and technological capabilities—indicates that while the "what, how, and who" are largely defined, their full and seamless implementation is still a work in progress.

**Suggestion:**

To strengthen the "how" and "who" aspects of decision-making, I recommend establishing a **"Strategic Data Council"** comprising key leaders from Planning, Finance, IT, Data Science, Marketing, and Operations. This council would be tasked with:

1. **Standardising Data Governance:** Defining universal metrics, data ownership, and quality standards across all business units.
2. **Prioritising Technology Investments:** Collaboratively identifying and funding the most impactful technology and data infrastructure projects (e.g., centralised data lake, integrated BI dashboards) that directly enable faster, more accurate decision-making.
3. **Fostering Data Literacy:** Overseeing the creation and implementation of training programmes to empower all employees to understand and utilise the newly available data and tools.

This approach would centralise efforts, break down data silos, and ensure that decision-making processes are uniformly supported by high-quality, accessible data, enabling talisis to achieve its strategic objectives with greater agility.

o   ¿En dónde se documentan y cómo se despliegan las decisiones tomadas o los nuevos estándares una vez definidos?

talisis has a multifaceted approach to documenting and deploying decisions and new standards, although several leaders indicate that this process is still evolving and requires further systematisation and technological enhancement.

**I. Documentation of Decisions and New Standards**

Decisions and new standards within talisis are documented through a combination of formal processes, strategic initiatives, and increasingly, through digital platforms and data repositories:

- **Formal Process Documentation:** There is a clear recognition of the need for formal documentation. Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, highlights the importance of "políticas o procedimientos que vamos a en los que estamos trabajando" to ensure efficient budgeting and project evaluation. Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, explicitly states the ambition to create a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos" to enable structured and efficient long-term planning, thereby reducing the need for constant emergency responses. Julián Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, echoes this sentiment, desiring a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos" as a central "cerebro de datos" for consolidated knowledge and consistent communication. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, also underscores the importance of maintaining "controles internos robustos" within her mission, which implicitly requires documented procedures.
    
- **Strategic Planning Documents:** High-level strategic decisions are enshrined in overarching plans, such as the "arquitectura de Horizontes". A significant initiative, "Talysist Bit" (or "talisis Bit"), led by Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, is described as a "Business Management Plan" that defines the rhythm, communication, and actions of the entire organisation towards its strategic objectives. This plan outlines phases for conceptualisation, modelling, planning, deployment, and execution, indicating a structured documentation of strategic decisions.
    
- **Meeting Outputs and Performance Metrics (OKRs/KPIs):** Decisions are regularly made and documented during various meetings. Carlos Granados, CIO, specifies that "decisiones clave se tomarán a través de comités técnicos y de gobernanza," operating at strategic (monthly), tactical (fortnightly), and operational (weekly) levels. These forums serve as points for formalising decisions. The organisation also uses OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to define and track objectives, providing a documented framework for performance and strategic alignment. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Accreditation, describes a "matriz de congruencia" with 14 key indicators linked to the institutional mission, reviewed quarterly, which serves as a documented measure of compliance.
    
- **Digital Platforms and Dashboards (Aspirational/Developing):** A major aspiration across various departments is to centralise and visualise data to support rapid decision-making. Alberto Sánchez desires "información visual para todos" in "tiempo real o casi" to replace dispersed Excel files and static presentations. Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, is actively implementing "dashboards centralizados y mediciones automáticas o en tiempo real" to monitor operational processes. Marcela Valdez also aims to "concentrar los tableros de de de información que mueven las palancas". Román de León, Data Scientist, seeks to "reducir los reportes... a unos tableros dinámicos con mayor frecuencia de actualización". Carlos Granados mentions an "informe estratégico que puede incluir dashboards y gráficas para facilitar la toma de decisiones" based on interview data. The "Reporte Nicho" corroborates this vision, highlighting "Plataforma talisis.com, analítica predictiva para reducir deserción, IA para personalización, y arquitectura tecnológica unificada que conecta todas las operaciones" as a systemic manifestation, aiming for a "mente TALISIS" that conceptualises, guides, and recommends. Luis Ruiz also lists "Construir esta arquitectura de datos" as a priority project to gather comprehensive information about users.
    

**II. Deployment of Decisions and New Standards**

The deployment of decisions and new standards in talisis relies on a combination of formal communication channels, defined governance structures, and ongoing efforts to leverage technology and foster a supportive culture:

- **Formal Communication Channels and Organisational Rituals:**
    
    - **Company-Wide Events:** talisis employs large-scale "rituales" such as "connections," "conventions," and "town halls" to cascade strategic information and decisions from top management (C-level) throughout the organisation. Inge Ploennig commends the improved format of town halls for effectively communicating the institutional vision and context. Mariel Serrano's area, Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence, is responsible for a "estrategia de comunicación transversal" that ensures consistent messaging and supports all business areas.
    - **Regular Meetings and Feedback Loops:** Within departments, "rituales semanales" like brainstorming sessions are used to discuss and disseminate new ideas and operational adjustments. Juan Arenas, COO, emphasises his role in "retroalimentar sobre los procesos diseñados" to ensure their practical applicability in the field. Carlos Granados also describes a system for collecting user feedback directly through applications, where comments can inform future developments and directly influence the deployment of new functionalities.
- **Governance Structures:** The multi-tiered committee system (Strategic, Tactical, Operational) described by Carlos Granados is central to deploying decisions. Strategic directives from the highest level are broken down and implemented by project leaders and technical teams, ensuring alignment and accountability. Marcos Samaniego also participates in "comités" where alliances and strategies are discussed before being deployed to campuses.
    
- **Technological Enablement (Current and Future State):**
    
    - **Unified Data Architecture:** A critical goal is to overcome current data fragmentation and manual processes. The vision is to build an "arquitectura tecnológica unificada" or "cerebro digital" that can automatically collect, process, and disseminate information across all platforms, enabling faster and more informed decisions. This centralisation is expected to facilitate the rapid deployment of new standards and insights.
    - **Automation:** The automation of administrative and operational processes is a significant focus, as it can embed new standards directly into workflows, reducing manual effort, errors, and speeding up execution. Juliana Effting explicitly states the need to "estandarizarlos, en construirlos" before leveraging cloud technology for automated flows. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, desires to "dejar a un lado procesos manuales, y burocráticos, para evolucionar a a procesos más estandarizados".
    - **AI for Personalisation and Support:** The use of AI is envisioned to personalise learning experiences and provide timely support, effectively deploying tailored educational approaches at scale. This includes AI-powered "tutorías" and predictive models for student retention, directly influencing how new pedagogical standards are deployed and experienced by students.
- **Leadership and Culture of Accountability:**
    
    - **Clarity and Compliance:** Alberto Sánchez stresses that once policies are "autorizados por ellos estos estas políticas o procedimientos... que se cumplan". This indicates that leaders are expected to ensure adherence to new standards. Domingo Farias also pushes for departments to have "mayor claridad de qué es lo que que necesitamos cumplir en este año".
    - **Collaborative Culture:** There's a strong emphasis on fostering a culture of "cocreación", "corresponsabilidad", and "empoderamiento real de los equipos". Román de León desires that leaders and colleagues "se involucren de manera temprana" in new solutions, moving away from a client-provider dynamic. This implies that the deployment of decisions is not merely a top-down mandate but involves active participation and buy-in from all levels. Joel Enriquez highlights the "Talysist Bit" project as a cultural endeavour to ensure "más de 1500 personas trabajen con foco ritmo, y sentido común", thereby embedding the strategic rhythm into the organisation's core.

talisis's strategy for documenting and deploying decisions and standards is moving towards a more integrated, data-driven, and collaborative model. While formal structures and communication channels are in place, the future vision involves significant technological advancements to centralise data and automate processes, complemented by a culture that values shared purpose, collaboration, and continuous adaptation.

To accelerate the transition to a more integrated and data-driven documentation and deployment system, I recommend establishing a **"Cross-Functional Data & Process Harmonisation Task Force."** This task force, comprising representatives from IT, Data Science, Operations, Finance, Academic Affairs, and HR, would be responsible for:

1. **Auditing Existing Documentation & Data Flows:** Identifying all current documentation repositories, data sources, and information flow processes (manual and automated) across the organisation.
2. **Defining Standard Data Models & Metric Definitions:** Collaboratively establishing a universal language for key business metrics and data elements to resolve inconsistencies and fragmentation.
3. **Prioritising Automation & Integration Projects:** Based on the audit and standardised definitions, creating a prioritised roadmap for integrating disparate systems and automating manual data collection and reporting, directly supporting the development of centralised dashboards and a unified data lake.

This task force would address the frequently mentioned challenges of data fragmentation, manual processes, and lack of clarity, providing a foundational structure upon which more efficient decision deployment can be built.

o   ¿Cómo se escalan los problemas?

talisis addresses challenges and issues through a multi-layered approach that encompasses formal governance structures, feedback mechanisms, technological solutions, and a strong push for cultural and process standardisation. While some problem-solving currently relies on reactive and manual efforts, the strategic direction is clearly towards more proactive, data-driven, and automated systems for problem identification and resolution.

**I. Problem Identification and Feedback Mechanisms:**

talisis gathers information on problems through various channels:

- **Direct Stakeholder Feedback:** The organisation actively collects feedback from students, teachers, and staff. This includes formal surveys, "voice of the customer" mechanisms, and analysis of open-ended questions in Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys. Carlos Granados, CIO, is implementing an in-app rating component that directly solicits user comments, feedback, and complaints, with a system for following up on negative reviews to gather more detail. Juan Arenas, COO, similarly engages in constant dialogue with students, teachers, and staff to understand their "pains" and areas for improvement.
- **Data Analysis and Monitoring:** There is a significant emphasis on leveraging data for early problem detection. Carlos Granados's team uses tools like "Centric" for proactive error detection in applications, allowing them to address issues "before the user or student raises their hand". Marcos Samaniego's area conducts measurements and analyses of operational results to determine if processes are functioning as designed or require adjustments, providing feedback to process designers. Marcela Valdez aims to use data to understand profitability per programme and location, identifying root causes of underperformance. Román de León, Data Scientist, focuses on building robust data architectures and dashboards for continuous monitoring of key institutional indicators. Amalia, Director of Talent & Culture, uses AI for "analysis, understanding of certain pain points" to establish strategic actions.
- **Proactive Risk Management:** Leaders are tasked with anticipating external challenges. Joel Enriquez, CSO, views his role as "reading the context" of a world "full of tensions" to design adaptable strategies. Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, highlights the need for "reputational intelligence capable of reading and anticipating social movements" to mitigate risks like misinformation or reputational crises. Carlos Granados also envisions using AI to proactively identify students at risk of not graduating on time, to prevent negative brand perception.

**II. Communication and Escalation Channels:**

Once problems are identified, talisis employs established communication and escalation pathways:

- **Multi-tiered Governance Committees:** Critical decisions, particularly those concerning significant problems or strategic challenges, are addressed through a structured committee system. This framework ensures problems are handled at the appropriate level and escalated when necessary:
    - **Strategic Level:** C-level executives and Directors convene monthly to define vision and direction. This is the forum for escalating major, high-impact problems requiring top-level strategic decisions.
    - **Tactical Level:** Project leaders meet fortnightly to address implementation-specific issues.
    - **Operational Level:** Technical teams hold weekly meetings to resolve day-to-day execution problems.
- **Formal Organisational Rituals:** Company-wide events such as "connections," "conventions," and "town halls" serve as key channels for cascading strategic information and addressing overarching challenges from top management down through the organisation. Inge Ploennig praises the improved format of these town halls for their clarity in communicating the institutional vision.
- **Cross-Functional Feedback Loops:** Juan Arenas, COO, describes his role as providing direct "feedback on designed processes" to ensure their practical applicability and identify areas where they are not "really happening as planned". Marcos Samaniego's team similarly provides feedback to academic process designers based on operational results. Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, actively fosters conversations across departments to overcome "obstacles and dynamics" and ensure inter-departmental understanding.
- **Internal Liaison Roles:** Amalia's team functions as "the glue" between different areas, facilitating communication and fostering agreements to "fix situations" and resolve inter-departmental issues. Julián Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, advocates for "well-designed collaborative spaces" to "resolve among all the different circumstances".
- **Developing Digital Communication:** The long-term vision includes implementing automated alerts and centralised dashboards to provide real-time visibility into emerging issues. This would significantly streamline problem reporting and allow for immediate notification of relevant stakeholders. Carlos Granados specifically mentions a cloud service that can process negative feedback events and trigger automated, personalised email responses to users, serving as an automated initial escalation and response system.

**III. Problem Resolution and Improvement Approaches:**

talisis employs various strategies to resolve identified problems:

- **Proactive Prevention:** Leaders aim to prevent problems before they escalate. Carlos Granados suggests using AI to send personalised reminders for graduation requirements, preventing delays and reputational damage. Domingo Farias's goal of a "Human Engine for high performance" and improving talent attraction aims to prevent productivity and retention issues.
- **Structured Problem-Solving Methodologies:** Román de León, Data Scientist, describes the "Vadir methodology" – defining a business question, formulating a hypothesis, collecting data, generating insights, and validating the solution with the user – as a structured framework for problem-solving.
- **Process Improvement and Automation:** A consistent theme is the drive to transition from "manual and bureaucratic processes" to "standardised and faster processes" through automation and technology. This is viewed as a fundamental way to resolve inefficiencies, reduce errors, and accelerate operations. Juliana Effting explicitly states the "super challenge" of standardising processes before automation can truly be effective.
- **Cultural Alignment and Change Management:** Several leaders recognise that problem resolution often requires cultural shifts. Domingo Farias promotes integrating processes and a "high-performance culture" into the "DNA of each leader" to foster shared understanding and accountability. Mariel Serrano's "Talysist Bit" project directly tackles cultural alignment and synchronisation across the organisation to overcome challenges related to commitment and consistency. Paulina, Director of UNID, acknowledges that resistance to change and a conservative mindset within the workforce are significant obstacles.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** The push for centralised, real-time dashboards and robust data architectures is designed to enable "faster decision-making", allowing for rapid and informed responses to identified issues.
- **Resource and Capability Development:** Addressing problems such as limited time, small team size, or lack of specialised personnel involves advocating for adequate resources, fostering continuous learning and training, and exploring strategic partnerships with external technology providers to bring in necessary expertise and accelerate progress.

talisis's approach to escalating and solving problems is evolving towards a more integrated and proactive model. While existing structures handle day-to-day and tactical issues, there's a collective aspiration to leverage technology and cultural transformation to address systemic challenges, enabling faster, more informed decision-making and continuous improvement across all levels of the organisation.

To further streamline problem escalation and resolution, particularly across disparate systems and departments, I recommend initiating a **"Cross-Functional Process Mapping and Automation Initiative."** This initiative would involve:

1. **Selecting 2-3 high-friction, inter-departmental processes** (e.g., student enrolment and onboarding, content creation and deployment, or internal budget approval workflows) that are currently highly manual or fragmented, as highlighted by several leaders.
2. **Mapping these processes end-to-end** with representatives from all involved departments, clearly identifying hand-offs, bottlenecks, data discrepancies, and "pain points."
3. **Designing a future-state process** that incorporates standardisation, automation where feasible (leveraging existing or proposed technologies like AI and cloud), and clearer communication protocols.
4. **Developing a pilot for one of these re-designed processes,** with clear metrics for efficiency and error reduction.

This approach directly addresses the pervasive issues of manual processes, data fragmentation, and inter-area communication challenges, providing concrete improvements that would inherently simplify problem identification, communication, and resolution within those specific workflows.

o   ¿Cómo se pide ayuda?

Within talisis, the process of identifying challenges and consequently, how help is sought and provided, is multifaceted, drawing on a blend of formal mechanisms, cultural expectations, and direct appeals from leaders. It is often a reactive process triggered by identified gaps or inefficiencies, but there is a clear aspiration for more proactive, structured support.

Here's a breakdown of how help is requested and the types of support needed, based on the insights from various leaders:

**I. Direct Appeals for Support and Resources:**

Leaders explicitly state their needs for specific resources and capabilities:

- **Personnel and Budget:** Several leaders highlight the constraint of limited team size and the need for additional personnel to manage workloads and accelerate projects. Román de León, Data Scientist, directly requests "the hiring of one or two permanent persons" or "a budget to have one or two permanent people" to advance projects more agilely and prevent overloads. Luis Ruiz, Software Development Manager, also identifies "team size and the lack of trained personnel" as major challenges, implying a need for more resources. Similarly, Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, points to "limited budget, absence of full-time teaching leadership, and challenges in hiring leadership for laboratories", indicating a need for more funding and key hires.
- **Specific Technological Tools & Infrastructure:** The need for better digital tools and integrated systems is a recurring theme. Alberto Sánchez, Planning Director, explicitly states, "we need digital tools to be able to do it [automate budget and business cases]". Carlos Granados, CIO, seeks "a clear channel to know what students really need or want" and highlights the value of AI agents for scaling customer interaction. Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, mentions the need for "the necessary technological tools" to adapt to market changes. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, identifies "technology" as a significant obstacle, specifically the lack of "integrated systems" and the inability to "analyse information" beyond mere reports. Her team needs a "system that truly stores information and then analyses it" to avoid manual data integration. Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, echoes this, stating the need for "support from a central area to create a repository of all processes" and "a central data brain" to ensure consistent communication and prevent redundant efforts. Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, also requests "agile access to data strategic agendas, institutional priorities, and real reputational challenges".
- **Defined Processes and Clear Communication:** There is a strong call for clarity and structure in processes across the organisation. Alberto Sánchez asks for "support... for these policies or procedures that we are working on to be complied with" by leaders once authorised. Alejandro Madrazo stresses the need for "clear and documented communication" and "respect for processes" to avoid constant emergencies. Juan Arenas, COO, similarly requires "clear processes... openness, listening, enablers, allow those processes to function well, and a structure in time for everything that is done". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, seeks "communication, alignment, teamwork" from leaders and colleagues.

**II. Implicit Requests Arising from Identified Challenges:**

Help is often implicitly requested when leaders describe obstacles, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement within their domains:

- **Process Inefficiencies and Manual Work:** Many leaders lament the reliance on "manual and bureaucratic processes", leading to time consumption and errors. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, notes that the lack of integration between systems (like SAP and Core Banner) creates "open controls and risks of discontrol", indicating a need for robust system integration and design. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, desires to "leave aside manual and bureaucratic processes" for "standardised and faster processes".
- **Inter-Departmental Silos and Lack of Collaboration:** A pervasive challenge is the "disarticulation between key areas" and the difficulty in fostering "global or collaborative projects". Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, notes the struggle to maintain collaboration with the sales team, and requests "leaders of other areas willing to work with a shared vision". Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, explicitly calls for "openness and coordination between areas to build aligned messages, share relevant information, and avoid silos that fragment the institutional narrative". Román de León describes an environment where departments "do not validate the solution they want to achieve" with his team, seeking only project delivery, which leads to inefficiencies. Julián Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, highlights the need for "well-designed collaborative spaces... to resolve among all the different circumstances".
- **Cultural Resistance to Change:** Paulina Adalid, Institutional Rector, points out the challenge of students arriving with "very precarious knowledge" and "emotional and affective situations" post-pandemic, which requires teachers to "accept that challenge of continuing to train". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, notes the "lack of speed to adopt new technologies" due to fear, implying a need for cultural support for technological adoption. Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, and Domingo Farias both emphasise the need for leaders to be "committed with the organisation" and to "lead by example" to drive the desired culture. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, highlights "internal cultural resistance" where online education is seen as competition rather than an ally.
- **Need for Strategic Clarity and Focus:** Domingo Farias points to a "lack of prioritisation and focus" as a key challenge, indicating a need for clearer strategic direction from senior leadership. Inge Ploennig stresses the importance of having "a very clear objective" and focusing efforts to avoid being "good at nothing".
- **Talent Management and Development:** Domingo Farias reveals high turnover in sales advisors and the lengthy hiring process, signaling a need for HR support to streamline talent acquisition and retention. Alejandro Madrazo highlights the need for "much better teacher training".

**III. Channels and Methods for Requesting Help:**

While not always explicitly detailed, the interviews suggest various channels for requesting and offering help:

- **Formal Governance Committees:** Critical issues and strategic challenges are addressed in multi-tiered committees (strategic, tactical, operational). This is where major problems are escalated for top-level decisions.
- **Inter-Departmental Meetings and Rituals:** Regular meetings and "rituals" are mentioned as forums for collaboration, idea generation, and information sharing, where challenges are likely surfaced. Marcos Samaniego and Inge Ploennig both mention regular meetings to "give feedback" on operational results to process designers.
- **Direct Feedback and Dialogue:** Juan Arenas, COO, actively engages in "constant conversation with teachers, students, and collaborators" to understand their "pains" and areas for improvement. Carlos Granados is implementing an in-app rating component to solicit direct user feedback and complaints.
- **Liaison Roles:** Amalia Ortega's team (HRBP) functions as "the glue" between different areas, facilitating communication and helping "fix situations".
- **Proactive Analysis and Monitoring:** Román de León, Data Scientist, aims to build robust data architectures and dashboards for continuous monitoring of key indicators, which would proactively identify issues before they escalate. This implicitly serves as a way to "ask for help" by highlighting problems through data.

talisis seeks help through direct requests for resources and transparent processes, and implicitly through the identification of inefficiencies, cultural barriers, and technological gaps. The desired support encompasses additional personnel and budget, as well as integrated systems, clear communication, cross-functional collaboration, and a leadership culture that fosters autonomy and a shared purpose.

To address the recurring theme of **fragmented information and lack of integrated data systems** as a core barrier to effective problem-solving and decision-making, I recommend establishing a **"Centralised Data Governance and Integration Task Force."** This task force should:

1. **Map existing data sources and systems** across key departments (e.g., academic operations, finance, marketing, sales, HR) to identify current gaps, overlaps, and inconsistencies.
2. **Define a unified data dictionary and standard operating procedures** for data collection, storage, and access, ensuring data quality and reliability.
3. **Prioritise 2-3 critical cross-functional dashboards/reports** (e.g., student lifecycle, program profitability by location, talent pipeline) that provide real-time, actionable insights for senior leadership and operational teams.
4. **Pilot the integration of key systems** (e.g., SAP with Core Banner, CRM with academic platforms) to demonstrate tangible benefits in efficiency, error reduction, and informed decision-making.

This initiative would directly respond to explicit requests for better data and address the underlying causes of many operational and strategic challenges faced by various departments. It would simplify how problems are identified (through readily available data) and allow for more proactive and data-driven solutions across the organisation.

o   ¿Se aplica alguna metodología para el análisis y solución de problemas?

Yes, talisis explicitly and implicitly applies various methodologies for problem analysis and solution, ranging from structured frameworks to emergent, data-driven approaches. These methodologies are crucial for achieving efficiency, fostering innovation, and addressing organisational challenges.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**I. Explicitly Applied Methodologies for Analysis and Solution:**

1. **Vadir Methodology:** Román de León, Data Scientist, explicitly states that his team uses the **Vadir methodology**. This structured problem-solving approach involves several key steps:
    
    - **V (Visualise/Pregunta de Negocio):** Generating a business question and identifying the true actionable question they seek to resolve.
    - **A (Analyze/Hipótesis y Plan de Análisis):** Formulating a hypothesis and an analysis plan to gain a clear, data-driven vision of what they intend to build.
    - **D (Data Collection/Recolección de Datos):** Collecting the necessary data to execute the plan.
    - **I (Insights/Obtención de Insights):** Obtaining insights through statistics or machine learning.
    - **R (Resolution/Solución y Validación):** Finally obtaining the solution or constructing what was intended and validating it with the user. This methodology is used to guide projects from the initial question to user validation.
2. **OKR/KPI Frameworks for Performance Management and Problem Identification:** Multiple leaders refer to formal frameworks for setting objectives and measuring performance:
    
    - Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, details a "cascading" process where objectives are derived directly from the institutional mission and flow down to **OKRs and KPIs**. These are regularly reviewed in "rituals" (meetings) to measure progress and identify areas for improvement, emphasizing constant measurement for continuous betterment.
    - Julián Mendez, Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation, mentions that the **OKR system** is being implemented and polished within talisis, aiming for clear, measurable objectives across the organisation.
    - Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, also refers to **OKRs** for sharing objectives and ensuring all areas are aligned towards the same direction. These frameworks help in identifying deviations from goals (problems) and tracking the effectiveness of solutions.
3. **Continuous Improvement Cycles:** There's a strong emphasis on iterative enhancement:
    
    - Inge Ploennig outlines a cycle of "constantly measuring" and taking "corrective actions" to "integrate and polish our processes," which allows them to understand "what works, what doesn't".
    - Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, describes monitoring and analysing results to adjust and continuously improve the academic model.
    - Juan Arenas, COO, also highlights collaboration for "designing future initiatives that allow us to keep improving and innovating processes and services". This indicates an ongoing, systematic approach to refining operations and offerings.
4. **Agile/Iterative Development:**
    
    - Carlos Granados, Software Development Manager, explains that his team divides projects into "small phases" to deliver "continuous value" and allows for "quick adjustments" if needed, avoiding long delays.
    - The "Mazinger Z" project, which involved AI for content creation, underwent "many iterations" to refine its outputs. This methodology allows for flexibility and responsiveness in developing solutions.
5. **Quality Assurance and Testing Methodologies:**
    
    - Inge Ploennig's area functions as a "filter" to ensure content quality, aligning "standards and criteria in our testing matrix". This ensures that new content and processes meet defined quality benchmarks before being released.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop AI Implementation:**
    
    - Román de León details the use of "Human in the Top Dashboards" where "the algorithm suggests, but the teacher values and decides". This methodology ensures that AI recommendations are reviewed and approved by human experts, blending technological efficiency with human judgment, especially in sensitive areas like education. They also provide "explanations of models with natural language" to enhance understanding and trust among users.
7. **Strategic Foresight and Scenario Planning:**
    
    - Inge Ploennig identifies the need for "a study more in the medium and long term" for curriculum relevance.
    - Joel Enriquez, CSO, describes his role as "reading the context" like "reading the wind before sailing," which involves designing strategies that are "adaptable but solid". This proactive approach helps talisis anticipate future challenges and opportunities.
8. **Process Standardisation and Documentation:**
    
    - Alejandro Madrazo, Academic Director, strongly advocates for "very clear and predictable processes" and "clear and documented communication" to avoid constant emergencies.
    - Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, emphasises the need for a "centralised documentary repository of all processes" to ensure consistent communication and prevent duplication of efforts.
    - Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, highlights the "super challenge of having standardised processes" and "defined and automated flows" for case resolution. These efforts aim to create repeatable, efficient, and transparent operational methodologies.

**II. Implicit and Emerging Methodologies/Approaches:**

1. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** This is a pervasive aspiration and an emerging methodology across many areas:
    
    - Alberto Sánchez, Planning Director, needs "digital tools" for "dynamic information" to enable "faster decision-making".
    - Carlos Granados seeks "a clear channel to know what students really need or want" to create "truly useful solutions". He also uses tools for error detection and agile adjustments in production environments.
    - Ángel Casan, Rector, expects AI agents to facilitate "data-driven decision-making".
    - Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, states that "decisions are made based on data".
    - Many leaders express the need for integrated dashboards, predictive analytics, and real-time insights to inform strategic and operational choices. The "Mente TALISIS" concept in the summary report encapsulates this vision of a central analytical brain.
    - Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, aims to "learn from our data" to understand program profitability and allocate resources more efficiently. This shows a strong move towards evidence-based problem identification and solution validation.
2. **Customer-Centric Feedback Loops and Design:**
    
    - Juan Arenas, COO, actively engages in "constant conversation with teachers, students, and collaborators" to understand their "pains" and areas for improvement, aiming to "advance in solving the pains" and "strengthening what they are doing very well".
    - Juliana Effting stresses the need to "survey, know, ask," and "do Focus Groups" to truly understand the student's voice and structure operations around them.
    - Katherine, Marketing Director, focuses on "listening to students through different aspects" like social listening to identify effective strategies and messages. This indicates a systematic approach to identifying problems and validating solutions from the user's perspective.
3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration for Problem-Solving:** Many leaders identify the need to break down "silos" and improve inter-departmental communication and coordination to address complex issues:
    
    - Fernando de Río notes that "various projects depend on real collaboration between the commercial team, IT, CX, and academia" and that "if these areas operate in silos or have misaligned priorities," it fragments the system.
    - Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, highlights the need for "openness and coordination between areas to build aligned messages" and avoid fragmentation.
    - Julián Mendez stresses the importance of "well-designed collaborative spaces... to resolve among all the different circumstances".
    - Román de León advocates for early collaboration sessions to define commitments and manage expectations. This collaborative spirit is seen as a key problem-solving mechanism, ensuring that solutions are holistic and integrated.
4. **Experimentation and Prototyping:**
    
    - Fernando de Río desires "confidence to experiment and autonomy to decide".
    - Paul Moch discusses "controlled experimentation" and "tolerance for constructive failure".
    - Carlos Granados uses open-source tools like GrowthBook for A/B testing.
    - Luis Ruiz suggests "implementing new technologies earlier, perhaps for proofs of concept, that eventually become robust solutions". This indicates an agile, learn-by-doing approach to discovering and validating solutions.

**III. Challenges in Applying Methodologies:**

Despite the adoption of these methodologies, several leaders point to obstacles that hinder their full and effective application:

- **Lack of Clear, Documented Processes:** Many processes are still manual, undocumented, or fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and "emergencies".
- **Data Fragmentation and Quality Issues:** Information is often dispersed across various unintegrated systems, leading to inconsistencies, unreliability, and a heavy reliance on manual data collection for analysis, which consumes valuable time.
- **Resource Constraints (Time, Budget, Talent):** Limited team sizes and constant operational demands ("firefighting") prevent dedicating sufficient time to strategic design, long-term projects, and skill development. There's a particular lack of technically skilled personnel for data-related initiatives.
- **Cultural Resistance to Change:** Some individuals or departments are reluctant to adopt new technologies or different ways of working, preferring traditional methods. Mariel Serrano mentions the challenge of ensuring collaborators "understand" and "commit" to new initiatives like "talisis Bit".
- **Lack of Transversal Governance and Shared Vision:** The "disarticulation between key areas" and misaligned priorities can impede global or collaborative projects. Fernando de Río highlights the absence of "clear governance" and "transversal leaders" to ensure a shared narrative.

talisis is actively working towards systematising its problem analysis and solution efforts through various methodologies, with a strong lean towards data-driven, technology-enabled, and agile approaches. However, overcoming internal challenges related to data infrastructure, cultural change, and resource allocation will be critical for these methodologies to reach their full potential and consistently drive the organisation's strategic goals.

Given the repeated emphasis on the need for clearer processes, improved data integration, and enhanced cross-functional collaboration, I recommend exploring the implementation of a **Process Mining initiative**. This would involve:

1. **Automated Process Discovery:** Using event logs from existing systems (even fragmented ones) to automatically map actual process flows as they occur in real-time, highlighting deviations from ideal paths, bottlenecks, and manual workarounds.
2. **Conformance Checking:** Comparing discovered processes against defined "ideal" processes (where they exist) or desired future states, immediately identifying non-compliance and areas for re-engineering.
3. **Performance Analysis:** Quantifying process metrics (e.g., cycle time, rework rates, resource utilisation) to pinpoint the most impactful areas for optimisation and automation, directly addressing concerns about efficiency and resource allocation.

This approach would provide an evidence-based, objective view of how problems manifest within operational flows, offering a concrete starting point for targeted solutions that align with the desire for automation, data-driven decisions, and reduced manual effort mentioned by multiple leaders. It would move beyond "believing" problems exist to "knowing" exactly where and how they occur.

o   ¿Se tiene algún sistema para fomentar ideas de mejora y su reconocimiento?

Based on the information provided in the sources, talisis does not explicitly detail one single, formal "suggestion box" system with a defined recognition program for all improvement ideas across the entire organisation [All sources]. However, the interviews collectively reveal a multifaceted approach and a strong cultural emphasis that actively fosters and, in some cases, implicitly or explicitly, recognises ideas for improvement.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Cultural Emphasis on Innovation and Continuous Improvement:** Many leaders highlight a strong organisational drive towards modernisation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making, which inherently fosters an environment receptive to new ideas.

- **Innovation as a Habit:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, articulates a core strategy of "cultivating a mindset of permanent innovation at every point of contact" and aims to make "innovation a habit" through "constant A/B testing, pilots, and new tools". This demonstrates a systemic approach to continuous experimentation and refinement.
- **High-Performance Culture:** Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, and Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, champion a "High-Performance Culture" and see themselves as "founders of organizational culture". This culture promotes a mindset of continuous development and an active search for improvement.
- **Constant Learning and Self-Improvement:** Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional en UNID, emphasises a "constant challenge to surpass ourselves, to acquire new knowledge". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, promotes "lifelong learning" and an "experimentation mindset" within her team.

**2. Structured and Collaborative Spaces for Idea Generation and Refinement:** Several formal and informal mechanisms exist within different areas for generating and discussing ideas for improvement:

- **Brainstorming and Ideation Sessions:** Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, mentions weekly "lluvia de ideas" (brainstorming) sessions within her academic area, specifically designed for reflection and generating new ideas for strategic projects. Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, also desires "more intentional spaces for design and ideation" for his team.
- **Co-creation and Feedback Loops:**
    - **Cross-Departmental Co-creation:** Román de León, Data Scientist, strongly advocates for early involvement and "co-creation" with other departments rather than a simple client-provider dynamic. He actively engages in "bi-monthly feedback sessions" with teachers to improve tools and solutions.
    - **User-Centric Co-creation:** Carlos Villa, Mobile Dev Lead, is developing a tool to capture direct user feedback on application usage (screens and buttons) and sentiments, aiming to inform future functionalities. Katherine Romero, Senior Marketing Manager, plans to "scale this relationship towards a continuous co-creation model" with teachers, students, and allies for designing educational solutions and campaigns. Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, stresses the need to "survey, know, ask, and hold Focus Groups" with students to structure operations around their needs.
    - **Collaborative Spaces:** Juan Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, values "well-designed collaborative spaces to think as a team" and "quality time to align and co-design".
- **Strategic Committees:** Carlos Granados, CIO, indicates that key decisions are made through "technical and governance committees", which serve as forums where strategic ideas and improvements are presented and evaluated for implementation. Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, also notes participation in committees for maturing alliances and translating them into actionable plans.

**3. Data-Driven Identification of Improvement Areas:** The organisation is increasingly relying on data and technology to identify areas for improvement:

- **Data Architecture and Predictive Analytics:** Luis Ruiz, Gerente de desarrollo de software, and Román de León, Data Scientist, highlight the priority of building a robust data architecture to collect comprehensive information (economic, academic performance, social context) about students, teachers, and administrators. This data then fuels the development of predictive models (e.g., for student retention) and personalised solutions.
- **Automated Analysis and Dashboards:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finanzas, seeks to improve the management of financial information for more agile decision-making. Many interviewees express a desire for "more exact data to make decisions" through "intelligent dashboards", automating manual processes, and reducing discrepancies. This data-centric approach aims to systematically identify what needs improvement.

**4. Implicit and Emerging Recognition of Ideas:** While a formal reward system for all ideas is not evident, recognition primarily occurs through:

- **Implementation and Impact:** Ideas that are integrated into major strategic projects, like the "talisis Beat" (Mariel Serrano, Joel Enriquez), gain visibility and recognition through their successful execution and measurable impact on organisational rhythm, communication, and reputation.
- **Empowerment and Autonomy:** Román de León explicitly desires for his team to have "autonomy to propose their own projects that they believe can generate an impact". This empowerment to lead and implement ideas serves as a significant form of recognition.
- **Leadership and Mentorship:** Leaders like Fernando de Río and Lilian Lozano express a personal purpose of inspiring and fostering the growth of their teams. This supportive environment, combined with constructive feedback (as mentioned by Carlos Villa), helps to value and guide contributions.

talisis is actively fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement through various collaborative mechanisms and a strong reliance on data analytics. While a formal, company-wide "suggestion box" with explicit recognition isn't described, the emphasis on co-creation, data-driven insights, and empowered teams suggests that ideas are encouraged, evaluated, and recognised through their successful implementation and contribution to the organisation's strategic goals and ongoing transformation.

Given the emphasis on "constant learning" and "experimentation mindset" within talisis, we could explore the specific challenges and successes encountered in translating these cultural aspirations into concrete, repeatable processes for innovation and improvement across all departments.

o   ¿Existe algún área para la administración de la mejora de procesos, procedimientos y sistemas’

Based on the information available in the sources and our conversation history, talisis does not appear to have one single, formally designated "area for the administration of process, procedures, and systems improvement" that centralises all such activities under one name [Query, general absence of a single explicit mention]. Instead, the function of driving and administering process, procedure, and system improvement is a distributed responsibility, evident in the mandates and ongoing efforts of several key departments and overarching strategic initiatives within the organisation.

Here's a detailed elaboration:

**1. Dedicated Areas for Transformation and Quality:** While not named generically as "Process Improvement Administration," certain areas have explicit mandates that encompass these functions:

- **Gerencia de Planeación Operativa y Transformación (Juan Mendez):** This area directly aligns with the query. Juan Mendez states that his mission is not just to "operate the change, but to design it and activate it," and crucially, to "sustain it until we can convert it into culture". He views his team as "arquitectos de este cambio sistémico", responsible for making the vision a reality through processes, capabilities, technology, and culture. This clearly positions his area as a key administrator of systemic change and process transformation.
- **Dirección de Calidad y Acreditación Académica (Inge Ploennig):** Inge's area plays a critical role in administering and ensuring the _quality_ of academic processes, procedures, and content. She explicitly focuses on "el sistema de calidad, poderlo implementar de tal forma consolidarlo de tal forma, que independientemente si toca una acreditación o no, ya esté todo dado". This involves strengthening existing frameworks, integrating rituals, clear processes, dashboards, and KPIs/OKRs to ensure continuous quality and systematic management of academic processes. She also adapted quality validation processes for content production using AI.

**2. Strategic Initiatives Driving Systemic Improvement:** Broader organisational projects are also designed to drive process and system improvement across departments:

- **Talysist Bit (Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, and Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation):** This initiative is described as a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos" and a "sistema organizacional que nos permita que más de 1500 personas trabajen con foco ritmo, y sentido común". It aims to "marca el ritmo de talisis cómo nos comunicamos, cómo accionamos, cómo actuamos y cómo nos conectamos como organización". By fostering synchronisation and a common purpose, Talysist Bit inherently pushes for aligned and improved processes across the entire company.

**3. Technology and Data as Enablers and Drivers:** The IT and data science departments are seen as crucial for enabling and driving process and system improvements:

- **CIO (Carlos Granados):** Carlos envisions AI agents contributing to "automatización inteligente" and "decisiones basadas en datos precisos y en tiempo real" to reduce bureaucracy and make operations more efficient. He mentions "reingeniería ágil" as a mitigation strategy for "procesos incompletos". Decisions on key projects are made through "comités técnicos y de gobernanza".
- **Software Development (Luis Ruiz):** Luis's area is responsible for "construir varias de las integraciones entre nuestros diferentes sistemas", including the incorporation of AI agents to "eficientar los procesos". A priority project is to build a "data architecture" to collect comprehensive information for generating solutions.
- **Data Science (Román de León):** Román's team focuses on designing and implementing a data architecture to understand the industry and student development, providing strategic visibility. He applies "algoritmos de machine learning para detectar patrones" and seeks to optimise processes like "programación académica" and content personalisation. He also advocates for a long-term "partner tecnológico" to "rediseñar la arquitectura tecnológica" and ensure processes function optimally.

**4. Operational Feedback and Identified Needs:** Operational and administrative areas, while not primarily "administrators of improvement," actively identify needs and provide feedback for process and system enhancements:

- **Chief Operations Officer (Juan Arenas):** His area integrates ideas and projects that "se convierten en habilitadores de la operación," and he is responsible for "retroalimentar sobre los procesos diseñados" to ensure they are "realmente ejecutables". This highlights a feedback loop crucial for process improvement.
- **Director of Administration and Finanzas (Marcela Valdez):** Her department identifies the need to "mejorar la gestión de la información" for more agile decision-making and addresses the "falta de integración entre sistemas" and the absence of a "master data bien diseñado" which create "descontrol y discrepancias". She also aims for "automatizar medios de pago y procesos de alta baja".
- **Director Académico (Alejandro Madrazo):** He consistently highlights the "fundamental need for 'procesos muy claros y muy previsibles'" to avoid interruptions and allow focus on innovation.
- **HRBP Director (Amalia Ortega):** Her area is "haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos" and she acts as a "pegamento de muchas de las áreas," facilitating communication to resolve challenges.

**Challenges and Ongoing Development:** Despite these distributed efforts, several interviewees acknowledge that the organisation is still on a journey towards fully mature and integrated process and system management:

- **Lack of Documentation and Clarity:** Explicitly stated that "certain processes are not documented" and that existing processes are often not "suficientemente claros y documentados".
- **System Disintegration and Data Inconsistencies:** A recurring theme is that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos". There is a recognised need for a "cerebro de datos" or "repositorio documental de todos los procesos".
- **Operational Inefficiency and "Firefighting":** Many lament that daily operations consume time, leading to a reactive approach rather than proactive process standardisation and innovation.
- **Cultural Resistance:** There are noted "barreras que iniciativas implican nuevas formas de pensar y operar" and "resistencia cultural interna".
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited personnel and time often hinder the full implementation of process improvements.

While talisis does not centralise process, procedure, and system improvement under one specific "department of improvement," these functions are clearly integrated into the roles of the "Gerencia de Planeación Operativa y Transformación," "Dirección de Calidad y Acreditación Académica," and are a core objective of strategic initiatives like "Talysist Bit." Furthermore, technology and data science departments are instrumental in designing and implementing these improvements, while operational areas provide critical feedback. The organisation is actively working to overcome challenges related to documentation, system integration, and cultural adoption to achieve a more cohesive and efficient operational model.

Given the recurring challenge of cultural resistance to change and new ways of working, we could discuss specific strategies talisis is employing or could employ to foster a stronger culture of adaptation and proactive process improvement, rather than a reactive "firefighting" mentality.

### VIII. Transformación y Gestión del Cambio

o   ¿Qué Procesos se quieren transformar?

talisis is actively engaged in a comprehensive transformation of its educational model, driven by its "Architecture of Horizons" vision for 2035. This ongoing evolution aims to enhance quality, efficiency, and relevance across the organisation. The transformation of processes is a central theme, encompassing both specific departmental operations and broader systemic changes, with a strong emphasis on leveraging technology and data for continuous improvement.

The processes talisis seeks to transform can be broadly categorised as follows:

**1. Core Academic and Curricular Processes:**

- **Content Production and Quality Assurance:** A primary focus is on ensuring that all academic content and curricular development are of high quality and standardised. This includes strengthening quality frameworks and integrating clear processes and KPIs/OKRs for continuous quality assurance. There has been a significant adjustment in quality validation for AI-produced content over the last 18 months, requiring alignment with new standards.
- **Program Pertinence and Design:** There is a strong push to ensure the "pertinencia de nuestros programas académicos" (pertinence of academic programs) for the future, looking 10, 15, or even 20 years ahead to predict market needs rather than just reacting to current offerings. The aim is to redesign and update programs (e.g., "Vive Unid") to align with future student expectations and societal needs.
- **Teaching and Learning Methodologies:** talisis is exploring innovations in the "delivery" of education and in "contenido y herramientas de aprendizaje" (content and learning tools). This involves rethinking the role of the teacher as a "facilitador" of critical thinking rather than just a technical imparter of knowledge. The organisation is "probando y tratando nuevos modelos, metodologías y formas de aprendizaje" (testing and trying new models, methodologies, and learning forms).
- **Curricular Homologation and Micro-credentials:** Efforts are underway to achieve "homologación de la malla curricular" (homologation of the curriculum). There is also a significant initiative to develop a "sistema de micro credenciales" (micro-credential system) as part of a more flexible and adaptable educational model.
- **Student Academic Journey:** Innovations are sought in planning and executing the student's entire academic journey, from "planeación académica hacia una planeación más integrada", to "diseñar mejores experiencias de aprendizaje dentro del aula", and improving "experiencias de titulación y graduación".

**2. Administrative and Operational Processes:**

- **Onboarding and Transitions:** A key area for innovation is making the "onboarding de los alumnos de los empleados y de los maestros sea suave". This includes streamlining the administrative flow for "altas, bajas y cambios" (registrations, withdrawals, and changes) for students, employees, and suppliers.
- **Financial Management:** The finance department aims to "mejorar la gestión de la información" for more agile decision-making and to address the "falta de integración entre sistemas" and the absence of a "master data bien diseñado" leading to "descontrol y discrepancias". Specific processes for transformation include automating "medios de pago y procesos de alta baja", optimising "conciliaciones", "análisis de la información y el entendimiento de las variables que impactan la rentabilidad". The goal is to make financial "gasto... rentable y productivo" and achieve "productividad incremental".
- **Human Resources Processes:** HR is "haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". Specific HR processes identified for transformation include automating "compensación variable de los promotores y asesores", improving the "curva de óptima de productividad" for new hires, and streamlining "contratación, las entrevistas, las referencias, la búsqueda de del mejor talento" to reduce high turnover.
- **Operational Control and Measurement:** Operations aims to ensure that designed processes are "realmente ejecutables" and to provide feedback for continuous improvement. This also includes "control específico de nuestras instalaciones, a través de la tecnología" and automating "procesos de medición y muchos procesos de colección de información y de procesamiento". The aim is to create a "centro único de trámites" for students to track their academic life.
- **Debt and Capital Management:** Alberto Sánchez (Planning) highlights the need to "administrar de manera eficiente los temas de deuda, los temas de levantamiento de capital, organizar de manera más eficiente... dónde asignamos los recursos, en qué rubro de costos, en qué rubro de gastos".

**3. Customer-Facing, Sales, and Marketing Processes:**

- **Sales and Lead Management:** The commercial area seeks to "automatizar y mejorar la venta en el proceso comercial". Marketing aims for "automatizaciones del funnel de adquisición, fidelización, y rentabilidad multimarca", and to use AI for "segmentación hiper personalizada" to tailor messages and channels.
- **Customer Relationship and Experience:** There's a strong focus on enhancing the student journey and experience to strengthen their sense of belonging. This involves making "el servicio al estudiante online" better by changing internal processes and ensuring "el alumno se sienta acompañado" in online education. The goal is to personalise experiences from the "primer punto de contacto" using AI.
- **Brand Positioning and Communication:** Mariel Serrano (Corporate Reputation) stresses the need to "comunicar de manera coherente esa mejora continua" and define "mensajes estratégicos que comporten como catalizadores virales y reputacionales". Fernando (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) aims to "rediseñar ofertas con un valor tangible y diferenciador" and "humanizar y transparentar nuestro historias".

**4. Cross-Cutting Transformation Needs:**

- **Standardisation and Documentation:** A recurring and significant challenge is the lack of clearly defined and documented processes. Alberto Sánchez mentions "ciertos procesos que no están documentados. Este, y ahorita estamos haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". Juliana Effting notes "hoy nosotros no tenemos flujos definidos y automatizados... tendríamos antes que trabajar en estandarizarlos, en construirlos". Marcos Samaniego calls for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos".
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** A fundamental shift is required to move from scattered and inconsistent data to integrated, reliable, real-time insights for agile decision-making. This necessitates building a robust "arquitectura de datos" (data architecture) to collect comprehensive information about students, faculty, and administrators and developing "dashboards más inteligentes con acciones sugeridas".
- **Automation and Digitalisation:** There's a strong drive to automate manual and bureaucratic tasks across all areas using AI and cloud technology to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human talent for higher-value activities.
- **System Integration:** Addressing the problem of "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos" and a lack of a "master data bien diseñado". The goal is to create "plataformas interconectadas" and "ecosistemas integrados".
- **Efficiency and Agility:** The underlying goal of many transformations is to reduce "burocracia" and "ineficiencia", increase the "rapidez y sentido de cambio", and enable faster decision-making.
- **OKR Implementation:** The implementation of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a key process transformation to establish clear, measurable objectives and provide continuous feedback across the organisation.
- **Change Management and Cultural Adoption:** Acknowledged as a significant challenge, overcoming "resistencia al cambio" (resistance to change) and fostering a culture that embraces new ways of working, particularly with technology, is crucial. Joel Enriquez's "Talysist Bit" project is a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos", aiming to ensure that "más de 1500 personas trabajen con foco ritmo, y sentido común".

talisis is embarking on a holistic process transformation journey that touches every facet of its operations, from how it produces content and manages finances to how it interacts with students and organises its talent. The common thread across these transformations is a move towards greater standardisation, data-driven insights, automation, and integration, all while maintaining a human-centric approach to education.

Given the critical and recurring challenge of data inconsistency and lack of a unified data architecture, we could delve deeper into the specific strategies and investments talisis plans to make in this area.

o   ¿Se aplica alguna metodología para la Gestión del Cambio?

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, talisis demonstrates an **emerging and evolving approach to change management**, rather than strictly adhering to a single, formally named methodology. While the term "gestión del cambio" (change management) is explicitly mentioned, particularly by Carlos Granados, the broader discourse reflects a proactive, adaptive, and iterative philosophy that seeks to embed change within the organisational culture and processes.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how change management is (or is intended to be) applied within talisis:

**1. Explicit Recognition and Strategic Intent:**

- **A Core Competency:** Carlos Granados, CIO, explicitly lists "Gestión del Cambio" as a crucial transversal competency required for the team to implement and manage the AI Agents infrastructure effectively. This indicates a recognition at the CIO level that change management is a distinct and necessary skill set for successful technological transformation.
- **Addressing Resistance:** Carlos Granados also identifies "Resistencia al cambio" (resistance to change) as a high-impact, high-probability risk for initial projects and proposes "Programa de gestión del cambio" (change management program) as a mitigation strategy. This suggests an intention to implement structured programs to address this common challenge.
- **Cultural Focus:** Julián Mendez (Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación) explicitly states that his area's mission is not just to operate change, but to design and activate it, and most importantly, **sustain it until it becomes culture**. He also highlights the "cultura de chain management" as something that talisis has "carecido mucho" and that changes are often "aventamos sin tener un change correcto". This points to a strong awareness of the need for structured change management and a desire to formalise it.

**2. Philosophy of Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:**

- **Mejora Continua (Continuous Improvement):** The concept of "mejora continua" is a fundamental principle, especially within the Quality area. Inge Ploennig (Director de Calidad) explicitly states, "Si no medimos, pues no hay forma de de mejorarlo y con base a las acciones correctivas estar integrando y estar puliendo nuestros procesos saber qué se funciona, qué no funciona, es como, pues, damos vida, ¿no? A este sistema". This systematic approach to measurement, feedback, and corrective actions is a cornerstone of iterative change.
- **Adaptability and Flexibility:** There is a strong emphasis on adaptability to external changes like market trends, technological advancements, social shifts, and regulations. Lilian Lozano (Digital Marketing Director) highlights "agilidad de cambiar programas de una manera modular" to respond to market needs, which implies a flexible approach to implementing changes in educational offerings. Juan Arenas (COO) also mentions adapting to shifts towards more hybrid and personalised education models.
- **Proactive Adjustment:** talisis aims to be proactive rather than reactive, using "foresight" to anticipate future needs and adapt programs accordingly. Humberto (Commercial Director) mentions the need to seek "nuevas tendencias que vayan evolucionando y ver cómo las podemos implementar" rather than just reacting to the market.

**3. Iterative and Experimental Approaches:**

- **Experimentation:** A culture of experimentation, including A/B testing and pilot projects, is promoted, particularly in marketing and product development, to learn and refine approaches. Fernando de Río (Chief Growth and Marketing Officer) states, "haremos de la innovación un hábito, no solamente una campaña busca un testeo constante de AB tests, pilotos".
- **Iterative Development (Vadir Methodology):** Román de León (Data Scientist) describes the "Vadir" methodology (Define Business Question, Formulate Hypothesis, Collect Data, Obtain Insights, Validate Solution), which is an iterative and data-driven approach to problem-solving and solution development. This systematic framework guides how his team approaches new solutions, inherently managing the change process for data-driven initiatives.
- **Phased Project Implementation:** Carlos Villa (Mobile Dev Lead) highlights a strategy of implementing projects in "fases pequeñas" (small phases) to allow for re-adjustment and flexibility if changes are needed, ensuring continuous progress and deliverables. This is a practical approach to managing large-scale transformations.

**4. Challenges in Current Implementation (and drivers for change management needs):**

- **Lack of Documented Processes:** A significant and recurring theme is the absence of clearly defined and documented processes. Alberto Sánchez (Director de Planeación) states, "ciertos procesos que no están documentados. Este, y ahorita estamos haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos". Alejandro Madrazo (Director Académico) highlights the current inefficiency due to frequent interruptions to "atender emergencias" because "no existen suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación". Marcos Samaniego (Director de Operaciones Académicas) also calls for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos". The very act of documenting these processes is a foundational change management effort.
- **System Integration Issues:** Multiple leaders point to "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos". The lack of a "master data bien diseñado" leads to "descontrol y discrepancias". This technological fragmentation necessitates a significant change in how data is managed and integrated.
- **Cultural Resistance to Change:** Despite the aspirational commitment to innovation, the "resistencia cultural interna" is acknowledged as a challenge, especially regarding the adoption of online education. Paulina (Director UNID) notes the difficulty in "no querer aceptar los cambios". Inge Ploennig (Quality Director) observes that "mucha gente lo ha acordado de miedo" when it comes to technology adoption.
- **Communication Gaps and Misalignment:** Fernando de Río highlights the "desarticulación entre áreas clave" and misaligned priorities. Román de León notes, "falta mucha comunicación entre departamentos". Mariel Serrano (Corporate Reputation) mentions the challenge of achieving 100% alignment for annual objectives. The need for "gobernanza clara" and "líderes transversales" is underscored.
- **Time and Resource Constraints:** Román de León (Data Scientist) and Alberto Sánchez (Planning Director) highlight that a small team and constant project demands make it difficult to keep up with technological advancements and process standardisation. This impacts the capacity to proactively manage change.

**5. Emerging Methodologies and Tools as Change Enablers:**

- **OKR Implementation:** Julián Mendez indicates that the implementation of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is an ongoing process of "pulido" and "adaptación de la metodología". OKRs, by their nature, are a change management tool for aligning objectives and driving measurable results across the organisation.
- **Talysist Bit Project:** Joel Enriquez (CSO) describes "Talysist Bit" as a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos" and to ensure "más de 1500 personas trabajen con foco ritmo, y sentido común". This project, driven by technology, aims to create a shared "nervous system" for the organisation, fundamentally shaping how change is orchestrated and adopted.
- **Technology as an Enabler:** The use of AI, Cloud, and data analytics is seen as a key enabler for transforming processes, from automating manual tasks and improving decision-making to personalising the student experience and managing financial flows. These technological shifts inherently require substantial change management efforts.

While talisis does not appear to follow a rigid, single change management methodology like ADKAR or Kotter's 8-Step Process explicitly named by its interviewees, it is actively engaged in a strategic and multifaceted transformation. This transformation inherently involves extensive change management, characterised by a strong philosophy of continuous improvement, iterative development, a growing reliance on data and technology as enablers, and a clear awareness of the cultural and operational challenges that need to be addressed through a more formalised and integrated approach in the future. The organisation is "doing the work" of change management, even if the formal methodology is still being consolidated.

Given the critical and recurring challenge of data fragmentation and the desire for "una arquitectura de datos" and "un solo dato para la toma de decisiones", we could further analyse the specific investments, projects, and expected outcomes related to building a unified data architecture and how this will support broader organisational change.

o   ¿Qué presupuesto se tiene disponible para los esfuerzos de transformación?

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, there is **no specific, quantifiable budget explicitly stated as available for "transformation efforts"** within talisis. The interviews frequently highlight the _need_ for investment and discuss resource constraints, rather than detailing a dedicated financial allocation for these efforts.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources do indicate regarding the financial aspects of transformation:

1. **Investment as a Strategic Imperative, not a Defined Budget:**
    
    - Many leaders identify the need for significant investment in technology and data infrastructure to achieve their long-term vision. Fernando de Río, for instance, explicitly states that resolving current technological limitations (fragmented platforms, dispersed data) "implies a strong investment and very capable people in data". Katherine, from marketing, also echoes the need for "tenerlas herramientas tecnológicas necesarias" and "una fuerte inversión" to address technology gaps.
    - The overall approach to systems, methodologies, and processes is consistently perceived as a "crucial investment" for talisis's future.
2. **Resource Constraints as an Obstacle:**
    
    - While financial budget for "transformation" is not specified, various interviewees point to **limited resources** – particularly in terms of _personnel_ and _time_ – as significant obstacles to advancing transformation projects.
    - Domingo Farias, from Capital Humano, identifies "recursos limitados" not primarily as economic, but in terms of "gente, hablo de tiempos, hablo de de de, o sea, de muchas cosas". He emphasises a "culture of doing more with less" and the challenge of how to achieve goals "con o sin recursos".
    - Similarly, Luis Ruiz, Manager of Software Development, explicitly states that "the time and current workload, the team is not large" is one of the main challenges, along with the "lack of trained personnel in technology". Paul Moch also highlights "limited time" and "lack of hands" to dedicate to design and strategy due to daily operational demands. Román de León, Data Scientist, notes that his small team struggles to keep up with constant project demands and new technology adoption.
    - Juliana Effting, Director of Online Education, lists "recursos y de estructura. Tanto recursos humanos como presupuesto, estructura organizacional" as obstacles.
3. **Explicit Requests for Budget or Resources:**
    
    - Román de León, Data Scientist, is one of the few who directly articulates a need for a specific budget allocation, stating: "I would like to have a budget for experimentation" and "a larger team since I only have one person under my charge". He further clarifies this, requesting "a budget to have one or two permanent people who could help us advance projects more agilely". This indicates that such a dedicated budget for his area's transformation-related efforts (experimentation, team expansion) is _not currently available_ or sufficient.
4. **Cost Considerations and Financial Health:**
    
    - The organisation is aware of the costs associated with technological shifts. Carlos Villa, Mobile Dev Lead, notes that migrating to the cloud "generates cost" and provides specific examples of monthly server costs, indicating a need to manage these expenses efficiently.
    - Alberto Sánchez's area focuses on ensuring that "the financial part is structured in a way that supports all internal and external needs. This includes CAPEX needs". He also seeks to manage debt and capital raising efficiently to align financial and strategic planning with market trends.
    - Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, prioritises "vigilar y propiciar que el flujo de efectivo mínimo se cubra", which implies a focus on short-term financial stability that might influence investment decisions for long-term transformation projects. She also highlights critical issues like the "lack of integration between systems" and the absence of a "master data well designed" as risks that imply a need for substantial investment to resolve.
5. **Efficiency and Cost Reduction through Technology:**
    
    - Paradoxically, technology is also seen as a means to _reduce_ costs and increase efficiency, rather than solely an expense. Inge Ploennig mentions using AI to produce content with "fewer resources, both financial and human". Álvaro García believes technology can "lower many training costs".

talisis deeply understands the strategic importance and necessity of investing in transformation (especially through technology and data infrastructure), the provided information does not disclose a specific budget allocated for these overarching efforts. Instead, it points to significant existing resource constraints (people, time), a recognition of the need for substantial future investment, and ongoing efforts to manage costs and seek funding for specific, high-impact projects.

Given the recurring theme of resource constraints, particularly in terms of personnel for key transformation projects, we could explore in more detail how talisis plans to address these staffing challenges. For example, we could look into whether there are plans for internal talent development, external recruitment strategies, or increased reliance on external consultants for these initiatives.

o   ¿Quién es el dueño de este presupuesto?

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the information does **not explicitly state who the specific owner is for a "transformation budget"**. While the question "Who is the owner of this budget?" is listed in the provided excerpts under the "Transformation and Change Management" section, no direct answer is supplied for this query.

However, the interviews offer insights into how financial resources are managed and allocated, which can be inferred to cover various initiatives, including transformation efforts:

1. **Distributed Financial Oversight:**
    
    - **Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance**, plays a central role in managing the company's financial health. Her responsibilities include "asegurar la precisión de las operaciones contables y financieras para la toma de decisiones, liderar la planificación presupuestaria el análisis de indicadores clave para mejorar la eficiencia de rentabilidad, cumplir con las regulaciones fiscales y gestionar riesgos proactivamente, manteniendo controles internos robustos, fomentar el desarrollo profesional del equipo, y promover la cultura talisis". She explicitly states her area "contribuye buscando que el gasto sea rentable y productivo y busca maximizar los recursos que son escasos para para lograr este sueño". She also highlights the need to "vigilar y propiciar que el flujo de efectivo mínimo se cubra" and manage the company's debt and capital raising. While her role is critical in financial planning and resource allocation, the sources do not designate her as the sole "owner" of a dedicated transformation budget.
    - **Alberto Sánchez, Director de Planeación**, is also deeply involved in "planeación estratégica y financiera". His role includes "organizar de manera más eficiente el los temas hacia dónde asignamos los recursos, en qué rubro de costos, en qué rubro de gastos". He notes the importance of "colaboración constante con las áreas es clave para evaluar y administrar proyectos" and "mantener alineación directa con el CEO para asegurar coherencia estratégica" regarding financial aspects. This indicates that financial allocation for strategic initiatives, including those related to transformation, is a collaborative and high-level executive decision.
    - **Carlos Granados, CIO**, mentions that "decisiones clave se tomarán a través de comités técnicos y de gobernanza," which operate at strategic (monthly), tactical (fortnightly), and operational (weekly) levels, involving "C-Level + Directores" for strategic decisions. This suggests a collective approach to major investment and project decisions, rather than a single budget owner.
2. **Focus on Resource Constraints Beyond Purely Financial Budget:**
    
    - Several interviewees highlight that the limitations affecting transformation efforts are often related to **resources beyond just money**. Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, explicitly states that when he refers to "recursos limitados," he means "no solamente hablo de económicos, hablo de gente, hablo de tiempos, hablo de de de, o sea, de muchas cosas". He notes a "culture of doing more with less".
    - Similarly, Luis Ruiz, Gerente de desarrollo de software, identifies "el tiempo y la carga de trabajo actual, el equipo no es grande" as a primary obstacle, along with "no tener dentro de la organización suficientes personas capacitadas en en tecnología". Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, also mentions "tiempo, no cuento con el tiempo necesario para poder centrarme en espacios de diseño... y la falta de manos". This suggests that while financial considerations are present, the challenge of securing and allocating human capital and time is equally, if not more, pressing in the context of transformation.
3. **Specific Budget Requests but No Overarching Fund:**
    
    - Román de León, Data Scientist, is one of the few who articulates a direct need for a specific budget, stating: "quisiera tener un presupuesto para experimentación" and "un presupuesto para tener una o 2 personas de planta que nos pudieran ayudar a avanzar de manera más ágil en los proyectos". This direct request implies that such dedicated and independently managed budgets for _his_ specific transformation-related initiatives are not readily available or are insufficient, necessitating explicit allocation.

talisis clearly recognises the need for significant investment to drive transformation, particularly in technology and data infrastructure, the sources do not identify a single "owner" of a dedicated "transformation budget." Instead, financial oversight and resource allocation appear to be integrated into broader strategic and operational planning, managed collaboratively by various leadership roles within Finance, Planning, and executive committees. The challenges faced often relate more to the availability of time, skilled personnel, and process clarity than solely to a lack of earmarked financial funds for transformation.

Given the recurring theme of shared responsibility and the challenges in aligning priorities across departments, a deeper analysis into talisis's current governance structure for cross-functional strategic projects might be beneficial. This could explore the effectiveness of existing committees, communication protocols, and accountability frameworks in enabling smooth execution of transformation initiatives.

o   ¿Qué porcentaje de los ejecutivos consideran conveniente entrar a un proceso de transformación en la organización y de qué niveles son?

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, it is evident that a remarkably high percentage of the interviewed executives consider it not merely convenient, but **essential and imperative** to engage in a comprehensive transformation process within talisis. The discussions from nearly all interviewees, spanning various levels and departments, underscore a deep-seated belief in the necessity of transformation for the organisation's future, competitiveness, and mission fulfillment.

While no explicit numerical percentage is provided in the sources stating how many executives consider transformation "convenient," the collective sentiment and detailed strategic plans articulated by 19 out of 20 interviewed leaders (Angel Casan's section states "No se cuenta con información") strongly suggest that **virtually 100% of the interviewed executives** view transformation as critical.

The executives discussing and leading these transformation efforts are from various levels of the organisation, predominantly in strategic and senior management roles:

**I. Executive and C-Level Leadership:**

- **Alberto Sánchez, Director de Planeación**: Actively seeks to modernise and automate financial planning and project management, moving away from manual, artisanal processes through digital tools. His role involves aligning strategic and financial planning for the organisation's future.

- **Inge Ploennig, Directora de Calidad y Acreditación Académica**: Her area focuses on continuous improvement and adapting to new technologies like AI for content creation. She notes that "talisis nada más va caminando en este proceso de transformación" and that failing to integrate technology would mean "nos quedamos atrás".
- **Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) y Director de Asuntos Estratégicos y Corporativos**: His work is centered on "construir un legado estratégico" and he describes himself as a "fundador de cultura organizacional," leading "programas de transformación estratégica".
- **Juan Arenas, Chief Operations Officer**: His area's core contribution is to "hacer que sucedan las cosas", continuously "mejorando e innovando los procesos y servicios", and planning for a migration towards online education.
- **Juliana Effting, Directora de Educación Online**: Identifies her area as responsible for the core operation of online products, needing "las personas, las herramientas, los procesos, los sistemas, todos muy homologados y muy listos para garantizar la entrega". She explicitly states talisis is "caminando en este proceso de transformación" and highlights the need for leaders to communicate clearly about the "transformación digital que estamos haciendo y que sí o sí vamos a hacer".
- **Katherine Romero, Chief Marketing Officer**: Views marketing as "una pieza clave para materializar la visión de talisis hacia el 2035," translating vision into "posicionamiento y acción". She explicitly highlights "transformación de competencias" as a key trend and concludes her section by stating, "El marketing de talisis está listo para ser ese motor de de transformación".
- **Lilian Adalid, Chief Marketing Officer**: Is inspired by talisis's purpose to "transformar comunidades a través de las personas". She actively discusses the impact of AI and automation in making processes more efficient and strategic.

Her area acts as an "Enabler" for "multicanal y multiproducto" growth through administrative processes and financial support.
- **Marcos Samaniego, Director de Operaciones Académicas**: Aims to "consolidar un modelo educativo claro" and "aumentar la calidad educativa". He is also focused on adapting to "personalización de contenidos a través de la inteligencia artificial" and implementing solutions more rapidly.
- **Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, Strategic Communication & Business Intelligence**: Seeks to position talisis as a "ecosistema educativo de vanguardia" and reflects on its mission to "transformar vidas". She describes "Talysist Bit" as a "proyecto transversal" and a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos".
- **Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning**: His role is to design "procesos, modelos, [y] políticas" to consolidate a clear and high-quality educational model. He discusses "repensar profundamente el modelo educativo" and adapting to new trends like microcredentials and hybrid models.
- **Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional en Universidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo**: Focuses on "formando estudiantes que tengan el conocimiento y las habilidades necesarias para desenvolverse profesionalmente en este mundo que es continuamente cambiando," which requires continuous adaptation and new teaching methodologies. She also mentions the need for constant training and new learning for her team to adapt to globalised needs.

**II. Manager and Specialist Level:**

- **Juan Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación**: Explicitly states that his area's mission is to "diseñar y activar" change and "sostenerlo hasta que podamos convertir en en cultura". He sees technology as a "catalizador de transformación digital" and talks about how the organisation has "madurado" significantly in its data-driven approach.
- **Luis Ruiz, Gerente de desarrollo de software**: Prioritises building a robust data architecture and implementing AI solutions to "transformarán tus procesos y responsabilidades" and improve educational quality.
- **Román de León, Data Scientist**: His area aims to "transformar la manera en la que opera el negocio" by providing innovative solutions and insights. He seeks a budget for "experimentación" and a larger team to "avanzar de manera más ágil en los proyectos" related to transformation.

The overwhelming evidence from the interviews indicates that the notion of "transformation" is deeply embedded in the strategic thinking and daily operations of talisis's leadership. It is not a matter of whether it is "convenient" to enter a transformation process, but rather a universal recognition of its necessity. Nearly every interviewed executive, from the C-suite to key management and specialist roles, articulates initiatives, challenges, and aspirations directly related to organisational, technological, academic, and cultural transformation.

Therefore, it can be concluded that **virtually 100% of the interviewed executives across all strategic and operational levels demonstrate a clear conviction and commitment to the ongoing transformation process** within talisis. They perceive it as fundamental for ensuring future growth, efficiency, and the fulfillment of the company's core mission to democratise and improve education.

Given this pervasive understanding and commitment to transformation, the next logical area of analysis could be to delve into the _specific challenges_ these executives foresee or are currently experiencing in executing these transformation initiatives, particularly focusing on how these challenges differ or overlap across various departments and levels. This could inform a more targeted approach to resource allocation and strategic support.
### IX. Gestión de la Capacidad y el Crecimiento

o   ¿Se sigue algún proceso de Planeación Estratégica?
Yes, talisis follows a comprehensive strategic planning process. This process is multi-faceted, highly integrated, and deeply rooted in the organisation's overarching strategic vision, known as the "Architecture of Horizons". It involves a continuous cycle of strategic foresight, market analysis, cultural alignment, and iterative measurement, underpinned by a commitment to data-driven decision-making and technological enablement.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the strategic planning process at talisis:

**I. Overarching Strategic Framework: The "Architecture of Horizons" (2025-2035)** The entire strategic planning at talisis is anchored by a clear, long-term vision to achieve significant impact in education by 2035. This "Architecture of Horizons" serves as the ultimate guiding principle for all planning and deployment efforts, ensuring that high-level strategic aspirations are cohesive and directed towards a common purpose.

**II. Strategic Planning and Objective Setting**

1. **Market Intelligence and Foresight:**
    
    - Strategic planning is heavily "centrada en en lo que el mercado requiere en las tendencias de mercado". This involves meticulous internal analysis to identify "qué programas son los que se están buscando o cursos los que están buscando, qué modalidades son las que está buscando el mercado, [y] por medio de qué canales de venta".
    - External monitoring is also crucial, including keeping an eye on "oportunidades que hay en el mercado" such as potential mergers and acquisitions.
    - Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, emphasizes "impulsando una visión clara del mercado, del estudiante del futuro", indicating a proactive approach to understanding evolving demands. Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, explicitly anticipates that talisis in 2035 "va a ser muy distinto" in terms of products, methods, and organisation, driven by AI and adaptive learning processes, showcasing a strong foresight component in planning.
2. **Leadership Involvement and Vision Setting:**

    - Joel Enriquez, Chief Strategy Officer, describes his role as central to "construir un legado estratégico," designing "estructuras que sobrevivan más allá de las modas o las circunstancias de hoy". He views his area as a catalyst for "programas de transformación estratégica".
    - Paul Moch, Vice President for Teaching & Learning, focuses on designing "procesos, modelos, [y] políticas" to "consolidar un modelo educativo claro" and "aumentar la calidad educativa".
3. **Objective and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    
    - talisis has a clear intention to implement and refine OKRs and KPIs across various functions to translate strategic vision into measurable outcomes.
    - Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, details how the "talisis Way" incorporates "13 strategic axes" that "se desprenden directamente de la misión," leading to strategic projects and plans executed at the campus level, all measured by OKRs and KPIs.
    - Julián Mendez, Gerente de Planeación Operativa y Transformación, confirms that "el sistema de los OKRs... se están implementando, nos estamos los estamos puliendo, estamos adaptando la metodología" to ensure clear, measurable objectives across the organisation.
    - Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, measures the success of strategic initiatives through "resultados estratégicos de la compañía," including "el pilar de crecimiento, en el pilar de de vida estudiantil, de de administración eficiente," along with "engagement" and "calidad de vida del colaborador".
4. **Budgeting and Investment Justification:**
    
    - Alberto Sánchez, Director de Planeación, details how financial planning involves structuring resources, managing CAPEX, and efficiently allocating funds to align with strategic goals.
    - Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration & Finance, includes "liderar la planificación presupuestaria el análisis de indicadores clave para mejorar la eficiencia de rentabilidad" as a core part of her department's mission.
    - Investments are justified through rigorous "business cases" and "análisis de productividad, costo beneficio".

**III. Deployment and Alignment of Objectives**

1. **Formal Governance Structures:**
    
    - Carlos Granados, CIO, explicitly states that "decisiones clave se tomarán a través de comités técnicos y de gobernanza," structured into strategic (C-Level, monthly), tactical (Project Leaders, fortnightly), and operational (Technical teams, weekly) levels. This tiered approach ensures strategic alignment, agility, and transparency.
    - Marcos Samaniego, Director of Academic Operations, describes participation in committees to understand the origin and maturation of alliances, ensuring their effective implementation in campuses.
2. **Regular Review and Communication Rituals:**
    
    - Information is systematically cascaded from top management (C-level) through various "rituales," including "connections," "conventions," and "town halls," to ensure clarity and alignment across the organisation.
    - Mariel Serrano's "Talysist Bit" project serves as a "Business Management Plan Integral para alinear y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos," acting as a rhythm for the entire company's communication and actions.
3. **Process Standardisation and Documentation:**
    
    - There is a recognized need to formalise and document processes. Alberto Sánchez notes that "ciertos procesos que no están documentados" are currently being documented, with an emphasis on leaders ensuring their compliance.
    - Alejandro Madrazo, Director Académico, stresses the importance of "procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación" and avoid emergencies.
    - Marcos Samaniego calls for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos" to centralise knowledge and ensure consistent communication.

**IV. Cultural Integration and Continuous Improvement**

1. **"talisis Way" as a Cultural Driver:**
    
    - The "talisis Way" is a foundational cultural framework that guides the organisation's strategic direction and operational methodology. It is viewed as integral to fostering a "High-Performance Culture," where leaders embody and instil desired attitudes and behaviours, aiming for "Alineación Cultural Total" where "Cada colaborador viviendo los principios TALISIS".
    - Julián Mendez stresses making people "vivir" the "cultural ADN" of talisis, embracing a data-driven approach and continuous evolution.
2. **Philosophy of Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:**
    
    - "Mejora continua" is a fundamental principle. Inge Ploennig states, "Si no medimos, pues no hay forma de de mejorarlo y con base a las acciones correctivas estar integrando y estar puliendo nuestros procesos".
    - There is a strong emphasis on adaptability to external changes, including market trends, technological advancements, social shifts, and regulations. Lilian Adalid highlights the "agilidad de cambiar programas de una manera modular" to respond swiftly to market needs.
    - Experimentation, including A/B testing and pilot projects (e.g., chatbots), is promoted in areas like marketing and product development to learn and refine approaches. Román de León's team actively uses the "Vadir" methodology for iterative and data-driven problem-solving and solution development, from defining a business question to validating solutions with users.

talisis clearly has a defined strategic planning process, which is comprehensive and deeply integrated into its vision, culture, and operations. While there are ongoing efforts to refine and mature its application across all levels, the strategic intent and foundational elements are well-established.

To further enhance the understanding of this process, it would be beneficial to investigate how talisis assesses the _effectiveness_ of its strategic deployment. This could involve exploring the mechanisms in place for capturing feedback on strategic initiatives from operational teams, and how this feedback loop directly influences future adjustments to strategic plans and objectives.

o   ¿Se tiene alguna función de Performance Management?

Based on the provided sources, talisis does not explicitly state that it has a singular, formally designated "Performance Management function" as a standalone department or operational unit [All sources]. However, it is abundantly clear that the principles and practices of performance management are deeply embedded and actively pursued across various strategic, operational, and human capital dimensions of the organisation, constituting a robust, albeit evolving, system of performance management.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how performance management is conducted within talisis:

**I. Strategic Framework and Objective Setting (The 'What')**

1. **Strategic Alignment via "Architecture of Horizons" and "talisis Way"**: The entire organisation's efforts are guided by a long-term vision, the "Architecture of Horizons" (2025-2035). This overarching vision is translated through the "talisis Way," which defines the company's core principles and identity, serving as a foundational framework for strategic direction and operational methodology. This ensures that individual and team performance aligns with broader organisational goals.
2. **OKR and KPI Implementation and Refinement**: talisis is actively implementing and refining its Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) methodology.
    - **Cascading Objectives**: Strategic axes derived directly from the mission are cascaded down, leading to strategic projects and plans executed at the campus level, all measured by OKRs and KPIs.
    - **Continuous Refinement**: Julián Mendez (Manager of Operational Planning and Transformation) confirms that the OKR system is "being implemented, we are polishing it, we are adapting the methodology" to ensure clear, measurable objectives across the organisation. This refinement includes ensuring clear, measurable objectives and facilitating continuous feedback.
    - **Specific Indicators**: Various leaders articulate specific performance indicators for their areas:
        - **Financial**: Marcela Valdez (Director of Administration & Finance) focuses on "efficiency and profitability", using indicators like "days of accounts receivable," "newly enrolled students (NIs)," and "re-enrolled NIs". Alberto Sánchez (Director of Planning) monitors debt, capital raising, and efficient resource allocation.
        - **Growth & Marketing**: Fernando de Río (Chief Growth & Marketing Officer) uses a comprehensive set including "cost of acquisition per student," "conversion rate per channel," "NPS," and "retention rate". Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) tracks new center openings, portfolio growth, sales, and sales force productivity. Lilian Adalid (Chief Marketing Officer) also mentions CPL, conversion rate, engagement, and CTR.
        - **Academic & Student Experience**: Inge Ploennig (Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation) links performance to institutional mission, regularly reviewing 14 key indicators. Alejandro Madrazo (Academic Director) uses "NPS docente, cumplimiento de promesa de valor, tamaño de generación". Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) measures "development of 21st-century skills," "educational quality," and "student employability". Marcos Samaniego (Director of Academic Operations) implements dashboards for automatic measurements of key operational processes.
        - **Human Capital**: Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) measures success through "strategic results of the company" across pillars like growth, student life, and efficient administration, alongside "engagement," "quality of life of the collaborator," and "NPS of managers". Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) focuses on "commercial productivity" and "percentage of retention of key talent".
        - **Technology & Data**: Carlos Granados (CIO) measures adoption, data quality, and satisfaction (NPS) for AI projects. Román de León (Data Scientist) tracks "agility in decision-making," "AI adoption in processes," and "reduction of student desertion risk".

**II. Performance Monitoring and Review (The 'How')**

1. **Regular Review Rituals**: talisis uses structured "rituals" for communication and review. These include "connections," "conventions," and "town halls" that cascade information from top management (C-level) downwards, ensuring clarity and alignment.
2. **Tiered Governance Committees**: Key decisions are made through technical and governance committees structured at strategic (monthly), tactical (fortnightly), and operational (weekly) levels. These forums formalise decisions and review progress. Marcos Samaniego also describes participation in committees to understand alliances and ensure their effective implementation, including measuring results.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: There is a strong aspiration and ongoing effort to shift towards data-driven decision-making. Many interviewees express a desire for "more accurate data for faster decision-making". Initiatives include developing centralised dashboards and automatic, real-time measurements. Román de León's team designs predictive algorithms and dashboards to support decision-making. Carlos Granados is implementing a system to track app usage and collect user ratings and comments to analyse sentiment and improve user experience.
4. **Continuous Improvement Cycles**: Inge Ploennig explicitly states that "if we don't measure, there's no way to improve it," and emphasizes "constantly measuring" to integrate corrective actions and refine processes. This reflects a commitment to continuous improvement as a core part of performance management.

**III. Talent Development and Culture (The 'Who')**

1. **High-Performance Culture**: Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) champions a "High-Performance Culture" as a primary strategic initiative. This involves setting high standards, rigorously attracting and retaining the "best fit" talent, and embedding a culture of continuous development into every leader's DNA.
2. **Professional Development**: talisis places a significant emphasis on the continuous professional and personal development of its employees.
    - **Identifying Opportunities**: Leaders like Humberto Salazar (Head of Sales) focus on identifying talent, their strengths and weaknesses, and the competencies needed for their next level. Domingo Farias aims to create a "map" of talent to strategically place top performers in key projects.
    - **Formal and Informal Training**: The organisation fosters a culture of ongoing learning, from adopting new technologies and methodologies to providing feedback and coaching. Lilian Adalid emphasizes "LifeLong Learning".
    - **Succession Planning**: Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) explicitly mentions the development of "key talent" and "replacement cards for our executives" as a long-term project.
3. **Managerial Accountability**: Leaders are expected to embody and instil desired attitudes and behaviours, and to manage their teams with clarity and support. Juan Arenas (Chief Operations Officer) highlights his role in motivating and inspiring his team to achieve objectives.
4. **Feedback and Communication**: Feedback is seen as crucial for growth and alignment. Carlos Granados actively gives constructive feedback to his team. Mariel Serrano promotes "clear, open, and empathetic communication" and "constructive honesty" (candor) to resolve conflicts and foster alignment.

**IV. Challenges and Areas for Improvement**

Despite these efforts, interviewees highlight several areas for enhancement:

- **Process Standardisation and Documentation**: Many processes are not yet fully documented, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of consistency. There is a desire for a central repository of documented processes.
- **System Integration**: Lack of integration between different platforms (e.g., SAP and Banner) leads to data inconsistencies, manual workarounds, and limits the ability to gain a holistic view of performance and operations.
- **Transversal Governance and Collaboration**: Some leaders note a "disarticulation between key areas" and a lack of clear governance for transversal projects, which can impede collaboration and shared purpose.
- **Data Quality and Accessibility**: While the importance of data is recognised, challenges remain in collecting high-quality, real-time data and making it easily accessible for all decision-makers.
- **Cultural Adaptation to Technology**: There is a need to overcome resistance or fear towards new technologies, fostering an agile and experimental mindset across the organisation.

talisis may not have a dedicated "Performance Management function" as a separate entity, it operates with a comprehensive and intentionally designed performance management _system_. This system integrates strategic planning, objective setting (OKRs/KPIs), regular performance monitoring and review, a strong focus on talent development and a high-performance culture, and a commitment to continuous improvement. The organisation is actively working to mature and formalise these processes, particularly through increased standardisation, system integration, and data-driven approaches.

Nonetheless, to further understand the maturity of performance management at talisis, it would be beneficial to investigate the specific tools or platforms used for performance reviews, goal tracking, and employee development plans. This could reveal the level of automation and integration supporting these processes beyond general discussions of OKRs and data.

o   ¿Se tiene alguna metodología para la Planeación de la Capacidad?

talisis does not explicitly state that it has a formal, defined "methodology for Capacity Planning" within the provided sources. The query regarding this specific methodology is listed in the general Tali responses document, but no corresponding answer is provided.

However, the interviews reveal a strong underlying focus on various aspects of capacity management, resource optimisation, and strategic planning that implicitly address capacity. There is a clear recognition of existing challenges and aspirations to develop more sophisticated, data-driven approaches to manage the organisation's capacity across its different dimensions:

**1. Recognition of Capacity-Related Challenges:**

- **Human Capital:** Several leaders highlight constraints related to the availability and allocation of personnel. Challenges include a "lack of sufficient staff", difficulties in "recruiting talent" with recruitment processes taking "50 or 40-odd days" from request to hiring, and the burden of small team sizes coupled with high workloads. The high rotation rate of advisors is also noted as an area for improvement.
- **Time and Resources:** There is a common sentiment that time and various resources (beyond just financial) are limited, hindering strategic design and project implementation.
- **Technological Infrastructure:** Limitations in integrated systems and data architecture are identified as significant obstacles to efficient management and analysis, which are foundational for effective capacity planning. Overburdened operational teams due to rapid expansion without proper structuring of staff and attention systems are also a concern.

**2. Strategic Focus on Efficiency and Optimisation:**

- **Resource Allocation:** Leaders, such as Alberto Sánchez (Planning Director), emphasize the need to "efficiently manage debt, capital raising, and allocate resources more efficiently" and "optimise the efficient distribution of costs and expenses using technology". Marcela Valdez (Administration & Finance Director) also highlights "liderar la planificación presupuestaria el análisis de indicadores clave para mejorar la eficiencia de rentabilidad" as part of her department's mission.
- **Automation:** A recurring theme is the desire and ongoing effort to automate manual processes to free up human capacity for higher-value, strategic tasks. Julián Mendez (Operational Planning & Transformation) notes that "certain processes that are very manual... should already be automated".
- **Economies of Scale:** Marcela Valdez explicitly aims for "incremental productivity" to "serve more students with economies of scale", indicating a goal to maximise output from existing or strategically expanded resources.

**3. Data-Driven Decision-Making as a Key Enabler:**

- A pervasive need for more accurate, real-time, and integrated data is expressed across various departments. This is crucial for "faster decision-making", which directly impacts the agility of capacity adjustments and planning. Carlos Granados (CIO) envisions AI agents as a "bridge that promotes efficient communication and data-driven decision-making".
- There's an aspiration to shift from merely collecting information to effectively analysing it to inform decisions. Inge Ploennig (Quality and Accreditation) points out that they "spend more time collecting information than analysing it", and hopes technology will reverse this.

**4. Specific Initiatives and Aspirations Related to Capacity:**

- **Student and Academic Operations Capacity:**
    - Expansion plans are a direct form of capacity increase, such as "expanding URL regionally" and "opening new learning centres" and "new portfolios". Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations Director) mentions "ampliar mucho más la cobertura".
    - There is a focus on managing "cohort size" ("tamaño de generación") as a key indicator.
    - Román de León (Data Scientist) outlines a project idea to "dimension teachers, classrooms, and schedules based on the probable number of students who will enrol, based on demand and the availability of physical infrastructure" using an algorithm. This is the most direct articulation of an **algorithmic approach to capacity planning** for academic resources.
    - Implementing a "unique centre for procedures" for students to track their academic life aims to streamline processes and improve operational capacity for student support.
- **Human Capital Capacity:**
    - Domingo Farias (Chief of Staff) describes efforts to "identify and attract the best talent to have a high-performance culture", including developing a "talent map" to strategically place top performers in key projects.
    - Amalia Ortega (HRBP Director) focuses on "commercial productivity" and "retention of key talent" as long-term projects, including "replacement cards for our executives".
    - The goal is to free up human capacity from "manual processes" so that it can be redirected to "culture, strategy redesign, productivity results and motivating teams".
    - AI is envisioned to accelerate sales force productivity by answering daily doubts and managing high-rotation positions like sales advisors by automating recruitment processes.
- **Technological Capacity:**
    - AI and cloud technology are seen as crucial for scaling operations and services, with an AI agent potentially handling "several prospects at once" to increase sales capacity.
    - Paul Moch (VP Teaching & Learning) highlights technology's role in "increasing and enhancing both learning and teaching in both spaces", and Marcos Samaniego (Academic Operations Director) expects technology to automate measurements and information collection to turn roles into "mentors" and "managers".
    - Building a "data architecture" to collect comprehensive information about students, teachers, and administrators is a priority project.
    - There is an aim to have a "digital brain" or "talisis Mind" that "integrates" data analysis, algorithmic personalisation, predictive recommendations, and intelligent coordination across all 190 educational centres.

talisis does not explicitly reference a single, formal "methodology for Capacity Planning," it is actively engaged in numerous initiatives that constitute a robust, albeit evolving, system for managing and optimising its human, financial, operational, and technological capacities. These efforts are heavily reliant on leveraging technology (especially AI and Cloud) and data-driven insights to achieve greater efficiency, scalability, and strategic alignment in its educational mission. The organisation is moving towards a more automated and integrated approach to understand demand, allocate resources, and measure performance across all its operations.

To further understand how capacity is managed, it would be beneficial to investigate if talisis utilises specific software tools or dashboards for real-time monitoring of key operational capacities (e.g., student-teacher ratios, classroom utilisation, platform scalability metrics) and how these insights directly translate into actionable capacity adjustment plans beyond aspirational goals.

o   ¿Cómo se lleva a cabo el ejercicio de presupuesto para el Capex y el Opex?

While the provided sources do not explicitly detail a formal, step-by-step methodology for how talisis carries out its Capex and Opex budgeting exercise, various interviews offer insights into the financial planning, resource allocation, and investment justification processes.

**Overall Approach to Financial Planning and Resource Allocation:**

talisis approaches financial planning and resource allocation with a strong focus on aligning with market trends and strategic objectives. The Planning and Finance areas are central to this. Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, highlights his area's role in structuring finances, ensuring economic resources, maintaining a healthy balance sheet and cash flow, and efficiently managing debt and capital raising. Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, underscores her department's mission to "ensure the accuracy of accounting and financial operations for decision-making, lead budget planning, [and] analyze key indicators to improve efficiency and profitability". Her area actively contributes by providing financial information and analysis, ensuring responsible use of economic resources, and offering internal "coaching or consulting" on productivity and cost-benefit analysis for organisational decisions.

**Budgeting and Forecasting:**

The budgeting process involves close collaboration and ongoing communication with internal stakeholders. Alberto Sánchez indicates a daily interaction with operations for "budget control" and "when we make the budget and when we make the forecast". His team also collaborates with Human Resources for payroll costs, and with Marketing and Sales to forecast income, costs, and expenses, assessing the ratio of marketing and sales spending against new income. This suggests a continuous and cross-functional effort in preparing and managing the budget.

**Investment Justification (Capex):**

For investments, particularly those related to Capex (capital expenditure), there is an emphasis on project evaluation. Alberto Sánchez notes that communication and collaboration with all areas are "constant" because "they are the ones who know what projects they have in mind, what's coming, and we need to manage all the funds, we need to do the project evaluation, we need to present it". This implies a process where proposed projects from various departments are assessed financially before approval and allocation of funds. For technology-related investments, Carlos Granados, CIO, specifies that decisions to integrate new technologies are based on criteria such as "viability técnica, compatibilidad con infraestructura existente y costos-beneficios". He explicitly mentions "TCO (Costo Total de Propiedad)" and "ROI esperado" as key elements in the "Análisis Económico" for these evaluations.

**Opex Management and Efficiency:**

Beyond just budgeting, there is a strong drive towards optimising operational expenses. Alberto Sánchez's area aims to "efficientar los costos y gastos lo más posible" and specifically to "optimizar la distribución eficiente de costos y gastos usando tecnología, más que solo reducirlos". Marcela Valdez's mission also involves improving "efficiency and profitability". This suggests that Opex management is not merely about cost cutting but about strategic allocation to maximise value and achieve economies of scale, such as her goal to serve "more students with economies of scale".

**Role of Data and Technology:**

There is a clear aspiration to leverage technology and data for more agile and precise financial management. Román de León, Data Scientist, proposes a project to "optimizar el presupuesto disponible" using an "algoritmo" based on "necesidades reales" and "retroalimentación" from students, aiming to "asignar el presupuesto de manera más ágil". This indicates a move towards a data-driven, potentially automated, approach to budget allocation. Julián Mendez mentions that "todo el tema de de presupuesto, todo el tema de business cases, es decir, de proyectos, este, que estuviera un poco más automatizado, más moderno, menos artesanal, menos uso de Excel, menos manual". Marcela Valdez also anticipates AI will "simplify the steps we follow to do our daily activity, from reconciliations... to the analysis of information and the understanding of the variables that impact the profitability of educational institutions". Carlos Granados envisions AI as an ally for improving forecasts and budgets.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

Several challenges hinder a perfectly streamlined budgeting and investment process:

- **Resource Constraints:** Leaders across the organisation, including Alberto Sánchez, acknowledge "recursos limitados" that encompass not just financial resources but also "gente, ... tiempos, ... procesos, recurso en herramientas". Luis Ruiz, for example, points to "el tiempo y la carga de trabajo actual" and the "falta de personal capacitado" as major obstacles.
- **Short-term vs. Long-term Focus:** Marcela Valdez highlights the critical short-term challenge of managing cash flow and accounts receivable, which can necessitate choosing immediate financial stability over potentially prosperous long-term projects.
- **Data and System Integration:** A recurring issue is the lack of integrated systems and unreliable data. Marcela Valdez mentions "la falta de integración entre sistemas, como el SAP y el Core Banner, genera controles abiertos y riesgos de descontrol", hindering accurate financial information. Inge Ploennig also states that they "spend more time collecting information than analysing it". Román de León also points out "inconsistencias de datos" due to "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada".
- **Documentation and Clarity:** Alberto Sánchez explicitly states that "ciertos procesos que no están documentados" are currently being addressed through documentation efforts. Alejandro Madrazo also points out the absence of "suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación".

While a prescriptive methodology for Capex and Opex budgeting is not explicitly detailed, talisis employs a strategic, cross-functional approach involving financial planning, ongoing budget control, and project-based investment evaluation. The organisation is actively seeking to enhance these processes through technology and data-driven insights, despite facing challenges related to resource limitations, data integration, and the balance between short-term demands and long-term strategic investments.

To gain a clearer understanding of the budgeting process, it would be beneficial to inquire if talisis uses a specific annual or semi-annual budgeting cycle, and what formal approval stages (e.g., departmental, executive, board) are required for Capex and Opex proposals once they have been evaluated.

o   ¿Cómo se justifican las inversiones que se quieren realizar? (Business Case)

talisis justifies its investments through a multi-faceted approach that combines strategic alignment, rigorous financial analysis, cross-functional collaboration, and an increasing drive towards data-driven and automated evaluation processes. The organisation views methodologies, processes, and systems as crucial investments rather than mere expenses, often justifying them by highlighting the high costs and inefficiencies incurred from a lack of proper systems or standardised procedures.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how investments are justified:

1. **Strategic Alignment and Market Focus:** Investments are primarily justified by their alignment with talisis's strategic objectives and market trends. Alberto Sánchez, Director of Planning, states that financial planning must be "centrada en lo que el mercado requiere en las tendencias de mercado" and structured to support all CAPEX needs to achieve long-term objectives. This ensures that resource allocation is in line with the company's strategic direction. Fernando de Río, Chief Growth and Marketing Officer, also emphasises investing "con inteligencia" to translate vision into concrete indicators. Mariel Serrano, Head of Corporate Reputation, describes the "Talysist Bit" project as a "Business Management Plan Integral" that aims to "alignar y sincronizar esfuerzos en todos los plazos" to achieve strategic objectives.
    
2. **Financial Evaluation and Metrics (Business Case Elements):** A core component of justification involves financial evaluation, often resembling a business case.
    
    - **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, indicates her area provides "coaching o consultoría interna" on "productividad, costo beneficio" for organisational decisions, aiming to "maximizar los recursos que son escasos" and ensure spending is "rentable y productivo". Carlos Granados, CIO, explicitly mentions "costos-beneficios" as a key criterion for integrating new technologies.
    - **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI):** For technology investments, Carlos Granados uses "TCO (Costo Total de Propiedad)" and "ROI esperado" as critical elements in the "Análisis Económico".
    - **Profitability and Efficiency:** Marcela Valdez aims to improve "efficiency and profitability" and measure "rentabilidad por programa, por ubicación". Álvaro García, Head of Corporate Sales, highlights "impacto económico" and "eficiencia operativa con márgenes y gastos". Humberto Salazar, Head of Sales, focuses on "mejorar el costo de adquisición y el aumento de la productividad de la fuerza de ventas". Lilian Lozano, Digital Marketing Director, also monitors "CPL" (cost per lead) and "tasa de conversión".
    - **Cash Flow and Debt Management:** For major strategic projects like the exit strategy for Promecap or mergers and acquisitions (M&A), Alberto Sánchez highlights the need to generate "suficiente caja y el generar suficiente EBITDA" to manage debt and ensure a "balance saludable" for external financing. Marcela Valdez also stresses the critical short-term challenge of managing "flujo de efectivo mínimo" and "recuperación de la cartera" (accounts receivable).
3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration and Project Evaluation:** Investment justification is a collaborative process involving various departments. Alberto Sánchez notes that "comunicación y colaboración" with all areas are "constante" because "they are the ones who know what projects they have in mind, what's coming, and we need to manage all the funds, we need to do the project evaluation, we need to present it". This implies that project ideas originate from different operational areas, which then need to be financially assessed and presented for approval. Carlos Granados's ideal collaboration involves strategic committees at various levels (strategic, tactical, operational) to make "decisiones clave". Fernando de Río also works closely with finance to decide "dónde invertir con inteligencia".
    
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making and Automation (Aspirational):** There is a strong aspiration to move towards more automated and data-driven justification processes.
    
    - **Automated Budget Optimisation:** Román de León, Data Scientist, explicitly proposes a project to "optimice el presupuesto disponible" using an "algoritmo" based on "necesidades reales" and "retroalimentación" from students. This aims to "asignar el presupuesto de manera más ágil" and ensure resources are better utilised for organisational objectives. He also mentions measuring "agilidad en la toma de decisiones" and "Adopción de IA en procesos y departamentos".
    - **Modernising Business Cases:** Julián Mendez, Operational Planning and Transformation, mentions the desire for "todo el tema de de presupuesto, todo el tema de business cases, es decir, de proyectos, este, que estuviera un poco más automatizado, más moderno, menos artesanal, menos uso de Excel, menos manual". Alberto Sánchez echoes this, desiring "herramientas digitales para para poder hacerlo" and "información visual para todos" in "tiempo real o casi".
    - **Predictive Analytics for Proactive Investment:** Carlos Granados envisions AI as an ally to improve "forecasts y presupuestos". Predictive analytics can also anticipate risks (e.g., student dropouts), which would inform where to invest resources for retention.
5. **Addressing the "Cost of Inaction":** Justification also comes from understanding the negative consequences of _not_ investing. Several leaders implicitly underscore the investment nature by lamenting the high costs, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities resulting from a lack of proper systems, integrated technology, or standardised processes. Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, notes that not having a consolidated quality system in place "generates re-work at all levels, physical resources, financial resources, it is stressful and leads to greater expense". Román de León points out that inadequate data quality and isolated systems lead to "inconsistencies de datos" and "rework" outside of systems. Marcela Valdez highlights how the "falta de integración entre sistemas, como el SAP y el Core Banner, genera controles abiertos y riesgos de descontrol". These "costs of not investing" provide a strong rationale for proactive expenditure.
    

talisis's investment justification process is evolving from traditional financial and strategic alignment to one that increasingly leverages data, automation, and cross-functional collaboration to ensure that resources are allocated to projects that promise the highest strategic impact and measurable returns, while mitigating the costs of inaction.

To further understand the maturity and effectiveness of their business case process, it would be beneficial to inquire if talisis has a standardised template or a formal checklist that all departments must adhere to when submitting proposals for significant Capex or Opex, and what specific post-implementation review processes are in place to assess whether the projected benefits (ROI, TCO, efficiency gains) were actually achieved.


### X. Relación con Clientes, Inversionistas y Autoridades

o   ¿Qué certificaciones se deben tener? ¿Se tienen?

Based on the comprehensive insights from the interviews, talisis operates within a regulatory and quality-driven environment, necessitating various forms of certifications and compliance. The organisation **does possess** several key accreditations and is actively working on maintaining and enhancing its adherence to diverse regulatory frameworks, while also pursuing new certifications that add strategic value.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the certifications and regulatory considerations for talisis:

### 1. Institutional and Programme Accreditations (Existing and Pursued)

talisis places a significant emphasis on formal academic accreditations, which are viewed as crucial for ensuring quality and building institutional prestige:

- **Finpes Accreditation:** Both the **Universidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)** and **Universidad Regiomontana (UR)**, which are part of talisis, are accredited by **Finpes (Federación de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educación Superior)**. This accreditation is explicitly mentioned as a means to "garantizar la educación de calidad ordenada que se brinda a los estudiantes".
- **Reaccreditation Processes:** UNID is currently undergoing a "proceso de reacreditación a nivel sistema de todo el sistema". Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, highlights that this process is not merely about obtaining a "sello" (seal) but aims for the "fortalecimiento de nuestro sistema" and a "mejora de cómo gestionamos todos nuestros procesos académicos". The aspiration is to achieve the "nivel más alto, que son 7 años" of accreditation.
- **Language Programme Certifications (Harmon Hall):** Harmon Hall, one of talisis's brands, has specific accreditations such as **TOEFL (Toffeely) and TOEIC (Toic)**. These are vital for demonstrating the quality and recognition of their language programmes, as "esas acreditaciones son parte de el valor que ve el alumno y que el mismo mercado lo pide".
- **Dual Model Certification (UNID):** UNID is notably certified through a "red de universidades duales en Latinoamérica", which enables it to offer the "modelo dual puro y como se llama en Alemania". This makes UNID "la primera universidad en México ofrece el modelo dual puro", signifying a unique and highly valued certification that also opens "mayores oportunidades laborales para los estudiantes al graduarse".
- **Future Academic Recognition:** Álvaro García, from Corporate Sales, mentions that for new content and learning resources, "van a requerir un reconocimiento de validez oficial". This indicates an ongoing need for official endorsement of their educational offerings.

### 2. Regulatory Compliance (Ongoing and Critical)

Beyond specific accreditations, talisis must comply with a range of legal and governmental regulations, which are continuously monitored and adapted to:

- **Fiscal and Financial Regulations:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly states that part of her department's mission is to "cumplir con las regulaciones fiscales". Her interactions involve "autoridades gubernamentales como son la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público la Comisión Nacional Bancaria de Valores, Economía, y y algunas otras", underscoring the critical nature of financial and banking compliance.
- **Labour Legislation:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, highlights the importance of staying informed about "reformas en el ámbito legislativo laboral" and working closely with labour advisors to "mantener cumplimiento normativo". Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, also notes that "temas sindicales" and the broader "sociopolítico" environment in Mexico can "afectar un poco" their operations due to their impact on organisational culture and productivity.
- **Data Privacy and Educational Norms:** Carlos Granados, CIO, stresses the importance of "cumplimiento de regulaciones internacionales" such as **GDPR/LGPD** and "Normativas educativas" when designing their AI and technological infrastructure. This indicates a proactive approach to data security and ethical AI use in education. Román de León, Data Scientist, further reinforces this by identifying "la regulación de datos educativos en OM-C37" as a critical external trend that influences his work.
- **Governmental Alignment:** Juan Arenas, COO, points to the necessity of allying with government institutions "para saber qué es lo que están haciendo y, por lo tanto, sumarnos a los proyectos estratégicos gubernamentales que nos permitan alinear nuestra oferta educativa". This proactive engagement ensures their programmes remain relevant and contribute to national educational goals. Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional, serves as a key figure representing talisis "ante nuestras autoridades ya sea autoridades educativas, autoridades gubernamentales, eclesiásticas, empresarios", further ensuring strong relationships and compliance.

### 3. Skill-Based and Micro-Certifications (Emerging Opportunities)

While not explicitly stated as having a large portfolio of _current_ skill-based certifications, the organisation recognises their growing importance and the opportunity to develop them:

- **Co-creation with Industry:** Fernando de Río, Chief Growth & Marketing Officer, mentions collaborating with the productive sector to "cocrear contenidos, certificar a las habilidades". This suggests an intention to develop and offer industry-recognised skill certifications, aligning education with employability needs.
- **Microcredentials and Upskilling:** The concept of "microcredenciales" and "cursos de educación continua" are discussed as flexible learning models to adapt to future job market needs. Román de León's insights also highlight the "demanda de UPSK" (upskilling) as an opportunity to "reciclar nuestros contenidos académicos de microlearning para empresas", implying that these micro-learning modules could lead to specific skill certifications.

### Perception and Strategic Value of Certifications

It's clear that certifications are not merely seen as bureaucratic requirements but as strategic assets:

- **Quality Assurance:** Inge Ploennig's perspective is that accreditation "asegura la calidad de el sistema educativo", albeit her personal view is that true quality "va más allá". The goal is for the accreditation process to genuinely lead to "mejoras" and a "fortalecimiento" of their systems.
- **Market Demand and Prestige:** Multiple leaders acknowledge that certifications (like those for Harmon Hall) are valued by students and "el mismo mercado lo pide". Accreditation also contributes to "prestigio" and positions talisis's institutions within a "grupo selecto de universidades".
- **Future-Proofing:** The continuous pursuit of new accreditations and compliance (e.g., with evolving data regulations, dual models) is part of talisis's strategy to stay "vigentes", "a la vanguardia", and responsive to changing market and societal needs.

talisis has a solid foundation of existing accreditations for its university programmes and is diligent in managing its regulatory compliance across various domains. There is a clear strategic intent to not only maintain these but also to actively pursue new forms of certifications, particularly in skill-based and micro-credential areas, to meet evolving market demands and solidify its position as a leader in educational innovation.

**Next Step Suggestion:** To further understand the effectiveness of talisis's certification strategy, it would be beneficial to explore how they communicate the value of these certifications and accreditations to prospective students and employers, and what mechanisms are in place for tracking the impact of these certifications on student employability and career progression.

o   ¿Se tiene algún trámite o permiso pendiente ante las autoridades?
Based on the comprehensive information from the provided sources, there is **no explicit mention** of any specific "trámites o permisos pendientes" (pending procedures or permits) with authorities for talisis.

However, the interviews provide extensive insights into talisis's ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies, its commitment to various forms of compliance, and efforts to adapt to evolving external landscapes, which indirectly touch upon the regularisation of processes or adherence to evolving norms.

Here is a detailed breakdown of talisis's relationship with authorities and its approach to regulatory compliance, as inferred from the interviews:

1. **Ongoing Regulatory Compliance and Interaction with Authorities:**
    
    - **Fiscal and Financial Regulations:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly states that a core part of her department's mission is to "cumplir con las regulaciones fiscales" (comply with fiscal regulations). She mentions active interactions with "autoridades gubernamentales como son la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público la Comisión Nacional Bancaria de Valores, Economía, y y algunas otras" (governmental authorities such as the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the National Banking and Securities Commission, Economy, and some others). This indicates a continuous engagement to maintain compliance, rather than addressing pending issues.
    - **Labour Legislation:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, highlights the importance of staying "muy de cerca con nuestros asesores laborales para poder pues realizar las las medidas y actualizaciones que sean necesarias, para estar cumpliendo normativamente con esos cambios" (very close with our labour advisors to be able to carry out the necessary measures and updates, to be normatively compliant with those changes). Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, also notes that "temas sindicales" (union issues) and the broader "sociopolítico" (sociopolitical) environment in Mexico can "afectar un poco" (affect a bit) their operations. These references point to ongoing efforts to adapt to and comply with labour laws.
    - **Data Privacy and Educational Norms:** Carlos Granados, CIO, stresses the importance of "cumplimiento de regulaciones internacionales" (compliance with international regulations) such as "GDPR/LGPD" and "Normativas educativas" (educational norms) when designing their AI and technological infrastructure. Román de León, Data Scientist, identifies "la regulación de datos educativos en OM-C37" (the regulation of educational data in OM-C37) as a critical external trend that influences his work. Katherine Romero and Lilian Lozano also discuss adapting to stricter "privacidad de datos" (data privacy) regulations. This demonstrates a proactive approach to evolving data protection regulations.
2. **Academic Accreditations and Reaccreditation Processes:**
    
    - Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, extensively discusses various accreditations. She confirms that both **Universidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)** and **Universidad Regiomontana (UR)** are accredited by **Finpes (Federación de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educación Superior)**.
    - UNID is currently undergoing a "proceso de reacreditación a nivel sistema de todo el sistema" (system-level reaccreditation process for the entire system), aiming for the "nivel más alto, que son 7 años" (highest level, which is 7 years). While this is an ongoing process that requires active engagement and adherence to standards, it is a **reaccreditation for quality assurance** and academic prestige, rather than a pending permit for basic operation. Inge clarifies that this process is not merely about obtaining a "sello" (seal) but aims for the "fortalecimiento de nuestro sistema" (strengthening of our system) and a "mejora de cómo gestionamos todos nuestros procesos académicos" (improvement in how we manage all our academic processes).
    - Harmon Hall also holds specific accreditations such as "TOEFL (Toffeely) and TOEIC (Toic)", which are considered "parte de el valor que ve el alumno y que el mismo mercado lo pide" (part of the value seen by the student and demanded by the market itself).
    - Paulina Adalid, Rector Institucional, notes that UNID is "certificados a través de la red de de la red de universidades duales en Latinoamérica" (certified through the network of dual universities in Latin America), making it "la primera universidad en México ofrece el modelo dual puro" (the first university in Mexico to offer the pure dual model).
3. **Adaptation to Regulatory Context for Growth and New Offerings:**
    
    - Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, mentions that talisis is "limitados realmente con algunas normativas" (really limited by some regulations) when attempting to grow, particularly for certain technical or health-related teachings. He also states that new content and learning resources "van a requerir un reconocimiento de validez oficial" (will require official validity recognition). This implies that as talisis expands into new areas or develops new products, they proactively seek to understand and meet the necessary regulatory requirements, rather than being currently held back by pending permits for existing operations.
    - Juan Arenas, COO, emphasises the need to ally with government institutions "para saber qué es lo que están haciendo y, por lo tanto, sumarnos a los proyectos estratégicos gubernamentales que nos permitan alinear nuestra oferta educativa" (to know what they are doing and, therefore, join governmental strategic projects that allow us to align our educational offer). This reflects a proactive alignment with national educational goals and regulations.
    - Paulina Adalid serves as a key figure representing talisis "ante nuestras autoridades ya sea autoridades educativas, autoridades gubernamentales, eclesiásticas, empresarios" (before our authorities, be they educational authorities, governmental authorities, ecclesiastical, businessmen), ensuring strong relationships and compliance.
4. **Internal Process Challenges (not external permits):**
    
    - While not directly related to pending external permits, several interviewees highlight internal challenges that, if left unaddressed, could indirectly impact compliance or operational efficiency. Marcela Valdez mentions a "falta de integración entre sistemas" (lack of system integration) and an absence of a "master data bien diseñado y cierres periódicos" (well-designed master data and periodic closures) in core systems, leading to "controles abiertos" (open controls) and "descontrol". These are internal control and data management issues rather than external regulatory compliance problems. Similarly, the widespread call for better documentation and clearer processes is about internal operational discipline.

talisis actively manages its compliance with various regulations (fiscal, labour, data privacy) and undergoes continuous academic accreditation processes, the provided information does not indicate any specific "trámites o permisos pendientes" that are currently holding back its operations or necessitating urgent regularisation. The focus appears to be on maintaining existing compliance, adapting to evolving regulatory landscapes, and proactively seeking recognition for new educational offerings as part of its growth strategy.

To gain a more granular understanding, it would be beneficial to inquire whether talisis maintains a centralised registry of all licenses, permits, and accreditations required for its operations, including their expiry dates and renewal statuses, to proactively identify any potential future bottlenecks.

¿Qué temas están pendientes de regularizarse?

Based on the comprehensive information provided from the interviews, there is **no explicit mention** of any specific "trámites o permisos pendientes" (pending procedures or permits) or "temas pendientes de regularizarse" (topics pending regularisation) that are currently holding back talisis's existing operations or requiring urgent outstanding compliance actions.

However, the interviews extensively detail talisis's ongoing, proactive, and continuous efforts to ensure compliance with various regulations, adapt to evolving external landscapes, and formalise internal processes, which can be understood as an ongoing process of 'regularising' or aligning their operations with best practices and legal requirements.

Here is a detailed elaboration of talisis's engagement with authorities and its approach to regulatory compliance and internal formalisation:

**1. Proactive Regulatory Engagement and Compliance:** talisis's leaders consistently highlight their commitment to adhering to diverse regulatory frameworks:

- **Fiscal and Financial Compliance:** Marcela Valdez, Director of Administration and Finance, explicitly states that a core part of her department's mission is to "cumplir con las regulaciones fiscales" (comply with fiscal regulations) and "gestionar riesgos proactivamente, manteniendo controles internos robustos" (proactively manage risks, maintaining robust internal controls). She mentions active interactions with "autoridades gubernamentales como son la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público la Comisión Nacional Bancaria de Valores, Economía, y y algunas otras" (governmental authorities such as the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the National Banking and Securities Commission, Economy, and some others). This demonstrates continuous engagement rather than addressing a backlog of pending issues.
- **Labour Legislation:** Amalia Ortega, HRBP Director, emphasises the importance of staying "muy de cerca con nuestros asesores laborales para poder pues realizar las las medidas y actualizaciones que sean necesarias, para estar cumpliendo normativamente con esos cambios" (very close with our labour advisors to be able to carry out the necessary measures and updates, to be normatively compliant with those changes) in response to "reformas en el ámbito legislativo laboral" (reforms in the labour legislative field). Domingo Farias, Chief of Staff, also notes that "temas sindicales" (union issues) can "afectar un poco" (affect a bit) their operations, indicating an active management of this external factor.
- **Data Privacy and Educational Norms:** Carlos Granados, CIO, stresses the importance of "cumplimiento de regulaciones internacionales" (compliance with international regulations) such as "GDPR/LGPD" and "Normativas educativas" (educational norms) when designing their AI and technological infrastructure. Román de León, Data Scientist, identifies "la regulación de datos educativos en OM-C37" (the regulation of educational data in OM-C37) as a critical external trend that influences his work, implying ongoing adaptation. Katherine Romero and Lilian Lozano also discuss adapting to stricter "privacidad de datos" (data privacy) regulations, which demonstrates a proactive approach to evolving data protection regulations.

**2. Ongoing Academic Accreditations and Reaccreditation Processes:** A significant aspect of "regularisation" in an educational institution is maintaining academic accreditations.

- Inge Ploennig, Director of Quality and Academic Accreditation, confirms that both Universidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID) and Universidad Regiomontana (UR) are accredited by FINPES (Federación de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educación Superior).
- UNID is currently undergoing a "proceso de reacreditación a nivel sistema de todo el sistema" (system-level reaccreditation process for the entire system), aiming for the "nivel más alto, que son 7 años" (highest level, which is 7 years). This is an active and continuous process for quality assurance and academic prestige, rather than a pending permit for basic operation.
- Harmon Hall also holds specific accreditations such as "TOEFL (Toffeely) and TOEIC (Toic)", which are considered "parte de el valor que ve el alumno y que el mismo mercado lo pide" (part of the value seen by the student and demanded by the market itself).
- Álvaro García, Innovation and Product Director, mentions that new content and learning resources "van a requerir un reconocimiento de validez oficial" (will require official validity recognition). This indicates that as talisis expands into new areas or develops new products, they proactively seek to meet the necessary regulatory requirements.
- Paulina Adalid notes that UNID is "certificados a través de la red de de la red de universidades duales en Latinoamérica" (certified through the network of dual universities in Latin America), making it "la primera universidad en México ofrece el modelo dual puro" (the first university in Mexico to offer the pure dual model).

**3. Internal Process Formalisation and System Integration:** While not external permits, many leaders highlight internal challenges in process formalisation and system integration that, if left unaddressed, could indirectly impact external compliance or operational efficiency. Addressing these is a form of internal 'regularisation':

- **Lack of Documented Processes:** Alberto Sánchez explicitly states that "hay ciertos procesos que no están documentados" (certain processes are not documented) and they are "haciendo la tarea de documentar esos procesos" (doing the task of documenting those processes), requiring leaders' commitment for compliance once authorised. Alejandro Madrazo notes that "no existen suficientes procesos suficientemente claros y documentados para poder planear con anticipación" (there are not enough sufficiently clear and documented processes to plan in advance), leading to inefficiencies. Marcos Samaniego also highlights the need for a "repositorio documental de todos los procesos" (document repository of all processes).
- **System Disintegration and Data Inconsistencies:** Marcela Valdez points out a "falta de integración entre sistemas" (lack of system integration) between Banner (core student system) and SAP (financial system), leading to "controles abiertos" (open controls) and "descontrol". Román de León (Data Scientist) states that "demasiados sistemas que trabajan de manera aislada por lo cual hay inconsistencias de datos entre esas plataformas" (too many systems working in isolation, leading to data inconsistencies between platforms). This indicates a critical need for internal regularisation of data flow and system architecture.
- **Need for Central Data Architecture:** Luis Ruiz (Software Development) prioritises to "Construir esta arquitectura de datos que... permita recopilar la mayor información posible de nuestros alumnos docentes y administrativos" (Build this data architecture that... allows us to collect as much information as possible from our students, teachers, and administrators). This is a foundational project to address data fragmentation and enable better insights and compliance.
- **OKR Implementation:** Julián Mendez (Operational Planning & Transformation) mentions that the OKR system is being "pulido" (polished) and adapted, indicating ongoing efforts to standardise and formalise objectives across the organisation.

**4. Adaptation to Evolving External Landscape:** talisis actively monitors and adapts to external changes that might necessitate "regularisation" or adjustments in its strategy and operations:

- **Socio-political and Economic Factors:** Domingo Farias highlights that "el tema político, sociopolítico" (the political, sociopolitical issue) can affect operations due to "temas sindicales" (union issues). Marcela Valdez also points out that a "entorno económico complicado y recesivo" (complicated and recessive economic environment) impacts payment availability and requires careful financial management. These factors demand continuous adaptation and potentially, adjustments to operational models to remain compliant and viable.
- **Market Trends and Competition:** Álvaro García notes that talisis is "limitados realmente con algunas normativas" (really limited by some regulations) when attempting to grow in certain technical or health-related teachings. Juan Arenas, COO, emphasises the need to ally with government institutions "para saber qué es lo que están haciendo y, por lo tanto, sumarnos a los proyectos estratégicos gubernamentales que nos permitan alinear nuestra oferta educativa" (to know what they are doing and, therefore, join governmental strategic projects that allow us to align our educational offer). This proactive alignment helps ensure their offerings remain relevant and officially recognised.

While the provided sources do not list specific, outstanding "trámites o permisos pendientes" for talisis, the organisation is clearly engaged in a continuous and proactive process of managing compliance with existing regulations (fiscal, labour, data privacy, educational), undergoing academic reaccreditation, and actively working to formalise and integrate its internal processes and data architecture. These ongoing efforts are crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, ensuring quality, and adapting to the dynamic external environment, which collectively contributes to the overall 'regularisation' and long-term sustainability of the institution.

To gain a more precise understanding of potential future regulatory bottlenecks, it would be beneficial to inquire whether talisis maintains a centralised and actively managed register of all licenses, permits, and accreditations, including their respective expiry dates and renewal statuses. This would enable the proactive identification of any upcoming mandatory regularisation processes and their associated timelines and requirements.
