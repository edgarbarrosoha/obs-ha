# Expertise: Citizen Participation

## Domain
Best practices in digital citizen participation and collective intelligence systems.

## Core Concepts

### The "Black Hole" Problem
Traditional citizen participation suffers from proposals entering a "black hole" where:
- Citizens submit ideas
- No acknowledgment is received
- No feedback on outcome
- Trust erodes over time

**SIC-Q Solution:** Every voice receives acknowledgment, routing, and feedback.

### 12-Phase Citizen Flow

| Phase | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Design | Define consultation scope and goals |
| 2 | Discovery | Citizen awareness and outreach |
| 3 | Registration | Easy onboarding (WhatsApp, web, in-person) |
| 4 | Conversion | Guide to participation |
| 5 | Orientation | Explain process and expectations |
| 6 | Participation | Collect input (voice, text, structured) |
| 7 | Storage | Secure, ethical data management |
| 8 | Sense-Making | AI-assisted clustering and synthesis |
| 9 | HA Analysis | Apply 6-dimensional framework |
| 10 | Reports | Generate stakeholder-appropriate outputs |
| 11 | Government | Route to decision-makers |
| 12 | Feedback | Close the loop with citizens |

### Participation Quality Ladder

1. **Information** — Citizens receive information (one-way)
2. **Consultation** — Citizens provide input (one-way return)
3. **Dialogue** — Two-way exchange
4. **Collaboration** — Joint problem-solving
5. **Empowerment** — Citizen decision-making

**SIC-Q Target:** Move from Consultation to Collaboration.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Acknowledgment rate | % of inputs receiving response | 100% |
| Accessibility | High school student can use | Yes |
| Feedback loop | Citizens know outcome | Yes |
| Virtuous cycle | System improves with use | Yes |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Tokenism:** Collecting input with no intention to act
- **Elite capture:** Platform only used by educated/connected
- **Tech solutionism:** Believing technology alone solves social problems
- **Political manipulation:** Using platform for electoral purposes
