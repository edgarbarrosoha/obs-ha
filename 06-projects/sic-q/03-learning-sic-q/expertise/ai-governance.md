# Expertise: AI Governance in Public Sector

## Domain
Ethical and effective use of AI in government citizen-facing systems.

## Core Principle: Human Interpretive Supervision

AI in SIC-Q must:
- **Augment** human decision-making, not replace it
- **Present options** with traceability
- **Enable** officials and citizens to exercise judgment
- **Explain** its reasoning transparently

## Governance Framework

### 1. Algorithmic Accountability

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Transparency | All AI decisions are explainable |
| Auditability | Full logs of AI processing |
| Contestability | Citizens can challenge AI outputs |
| Human override | Officials can override any AI recommendation |

### 2. Data Ethics

- **Consent:** Clear opt-in for data collection
- **Minimization:** Collect only what's needed
- **Anonymization:** Protect individual identity in aggregates
- **Retention:** Clear policies on data lifecycle
- **Access:** Citizens can view their data

### 3. Bias Mitigation

- Test for demographic representation
- Monitor for systematic exclusion
- Regular audits of clustering outputs
- Diverse training data and testing

### 4. Instituto del Futuro Role

The Instituto del Futuro provides:
- Long-term oversight beyond political cycles
- Independent audit capacity
- Public trust anchor
- Strategic direction for AI development

## AI Decision Points in SIC-Q

| Phase | AI Role | Human Decision |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Clustering | Group similar proposals | Validate groupings |
| Prioritization | Suggest priority order | Approve priorities |
| Routing | Recommend destination | Confirm assignment |
| Response | Draft acknowledgment | Review before send |
| Synthesis | Generate summary | Edit and approve |

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Bias in clustering | Medium | High | Regular audits |
| Privacy breach | Low | Very High | Encryption, access controls |
| Manipulation | Medium | High | Instituto oversight |
| Over-reliance on AI | Medium | Medium | Human-in-loop requirements |
