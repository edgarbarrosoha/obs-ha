# Skill: Benchmark Research

**Trigger:** `\benchmark [topic]` or "research benchmarks for [topic]"

## Purpose
Research and document international best practices in citizen participation, collective intelligence, and AI governance to inform SIC-Q design decisions.

## Protocol

1. **DEFINE SCOPE**
   - What aspect of SIC-Q needs benchmarking?
   - Geographic focus (Latin America, Europe, Asia, Global)
   - Specific features or approaches to compare

2. **IDENTIFY KEY CASES**
   Priority benchmarks for SIC-Q:

   | System | Country | Relevance |
   |--------|---------|-----------|
   | vTaiwan / Pol.is | Taiwan | AI-assisted consensus building |
   | Decidim | Barcelona | Open-source participation platform |
   | Consul | Madrid | Scalable municipal participation |
   | Porto Alegre PB | Brazil | Participatory budgeting origin |
   | e-Estonia | Estonia | Digital government infrastructure |
   | Singapore Smart Nation | Singapore | AI in public services |

3. **ANALYZE DIMENSIONS**
   For each benchmark, document:
   - Scale (population, proposals processed)
   - Technology stack
   - Governance model
   - Success metrics
   - Lessons learned
   - Applicability to Querétaro

4. **SYNTHESIZE FINDINGS**
   - What works across contexts
   - What requires local adaptation
   - Risks observed elsewhere
   - Recommended adoption for SIC-Q

5. **SAVE OUTPUT**
   - Save to `05-context-sic-q/benchmarks/`
   - Name format: `benchmark-[topic]-[date].md`

## Output Format

```markdown
# Benchmark: [Topic]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Scope:** [Geographic/thematic focus]

## Cases Analyzed

### 1. [System Name] — [Country]
- **Scale:** [Users, proposals, etc.]
- **Technology:** [Stack/approach]
- **Governance:** [Model]
- **Results:** [Outcomes]
- **Lesson for SIC-Q:** [Specific takeaway]

## Cross-Case Patterns

| Pattern | Evidence | SIC-Q Application |
|---------|----------|-------------------|

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt:** [What to implement]
2. **Adapt:** [What to modify for Querétaro]
3. **Avoid:** [What doesn't fit context]
