# UPU Finance Meeting — February 28, 2026

## Project Summary

**Project:** Postal Financial Services Knowledge Centre (PFS-KC) - Phase 1
**Client:** Universal Postal Union (UPU)
**Budget:** CHF 10,000
**Proposed duration:** 8 weeks

---

## What was proposed vs. what was delivered

| Original Proposal | What was built |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Functional AI agent prototype | Knowledge Base on AWS Bedrock + Agent with real-time streaming |
| Validation with 90% accuracy | Complete chat system with history, auditing, and traceability |
| Scalable codebase | Production-ready serverless architecture (Lambda, Cognito, Next.js 15) |
| Roadmap for future phases | Multi-brand theming + Amplify deployment configured |

**Conclusion:** Significantly more than Phase 1 scope was delivered.

---

## What was built (technical detail)

1. **Knowledge Base (AWS Bedrock)**
   - Documents processed with reasoning-capable models
   - Curated and structured content
   - Retrieval with citations

2. **Serverless Backend**
   - Dedicated Lambdas for chat streaming
   - True SSE-style streaming to browser
   - Dual invocation patterns (browser vs server)

3. **Data Layer**
   - Persistence: users, chats, messages, votes, tokens
   - Conversation history
   - Auditing and session continuity

4. **Security**
   - AWS Cognito + Auth.js (NextAuth)
   - JWT-based access control
   - Robust refresh handling

5. **Frontend**
   - Next.js 15 App Router
   - Multi-brand theming
   - Base-path support (root or subpath)

6. **Deployment**
   - Amplify workflows
   - CORS configured for Function URLs
   - Production-ready

## Key talking points

**If asked "what did we achieve?":**
> We delivered a complete AI agent system with real-time streaming, enterprise-grade authentication, and architecture ready to scale. We exceeded Phase 1 scope.

**If asked about Phases 2-4:**
> The current architecture already supports:
> - Knowledge base expansion (Phase 2)
> - UDP integration (Phase 3 — depends on UPU resources)
> - Multi-tenant / multi-brand (ready)

**If asked about infrastructure costs:**
> Remember: the CHF 10,000 budget does NOT include cloud costs, licenses, or AI API consumption. That's covered by UPU.

## Possible questions and prepared answers

| Likely question | Suggested answer |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "What's missing for production?" | The system is deployment-ready. Pending UPU decisions on domain, final branding, and user access. |
| "How is the knowledge base updated?" | New documents can be processed and reloaded into Bedrock. The process is documented. |
| "What if we want to add more countries/operators?" | The system already supports multi-brand theming. Configuration only. |
| "Monthly operational costs?" | Depends on usage. Serverless architecture = pay per use. Bedrock charges per tokens consumed. |

## Suggested meeting agenda

1. **Quick demo** (5 min) — show the agent working with streaming
2. **Technical review** (10 min) — what was built vs proposal
3. **Next steps discussion** (10 min) — Phase 2 or production?
4. **UPU dependencies** (5 min) — resources needed to move forward

---

## Work completed (detail)

* **Knowledge Base generation (UPU):** processed source documents (including images) with reasoning-capable models, curated and structured the content, and loaded it into an **AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base** to enable grounded retrieval and citations.
* **API & real-time AI streaming:** built a serverless backend with dedicated Lambdas for **Bedrock Agent chat streaming** and supporting services, delivering **true SSE-style streaming** directly to the browser.
* **Data layer & operational traceability:** implemented the persistence layer for users, chats, messages, votes, and token records, enabling chat history, auditing, and reliable session continuity.
* **Security & authentication end-to-end:** integrated **AWS Cognito + Auth.js (NextAuth)** with JWT-based access control, secure header-based auth for Function URLs, and robust server-side refresh handling.
* **Frontend & styling for daily use:** delivered a modern **Next.js 15 App Router** experience with configurable UI, **multi-brand theming**, and **base-path support** (root or subpath deployments) without breaking auth flows.
* **Deployment-ready configuration:** standardized environment configuration, Amplify deployment workflows, Function URL CORS setup, and dual invocation patterns (browser vs server) to ensure production stability and cost-aware scalability.
