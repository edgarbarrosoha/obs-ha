* **Knowledge Base generation (UPU):** processed source documents (including images) with reasoning-capable models, curated and structured the content, and loaded it into an **AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base** to enable grounded retrieval and citations.
* **API & real-time AI streaming:** built a serverless backend with dedicated Lambdas for **Bedrock Agent chat streaming** and supporting services, delivering **true SSE-style streaming** directly to the browser.
* **Data layer & operational traceability:** implemented the persistence layer for users, chats, messages, votes, and token records, enabling chat history, auditing, and reliable session continuity.
* **Security & authentication end-to-end:** integrated **AWS Cognito + Auth.js (NextAuth)** with JWT-based access control, secure header-based auth for Function URLs, and robust server-side refresh handling.
* **Frontend & styling for daily use:** delivered a modern **Next.js 15 App Router** experience with configurable UI, **multi-brand theming**, and **base-path support** (root or subpath deployments) without breaking auth flows.
* **Deployment-ready configuration:** standardized environment configuration, Amplify deployment workflows, Function URL CORS setup, and dual invocation patterns (browser vs server) to ensure production stability and cost-aware scalability.
