#### **1. Introduction and Context**

This document outlines a proposal for the first phase in the development of a Postal Financial Services Knowledge Centre (PFS-KC), a strategic initiative to centralize and analyze critical information regarding financial services across the global postal network.

Building on the success of previous collaborations, such as the development of AI agents for the 2IPD framework and the Dubai strategy, we propose a phased approach to build this new capability. This initial phase is focused on validating the feasibility and value of an AI agent as an analytical tool, utilizing a limited budget and delivering a functional prototype within a short timeframe.

#### **2. Aim of the Services (Phase 1)**

The primary objective of this first phase is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent prototype to demonstrate the capability of intelligently querying a specific knowledge base on postal financial services. This prototype will serve as a proof-of-concept (POC) and lay the groundwork for the development of the full-fledged PFS-KC as described in the UDP implementation plan.

The key objectives for this phase are:

1.  **Develop a functional prototype** of an AI agent that can process and understand data from the provided database.
2.  **Validate the agent's ability** to answer specific questions about the information contained within the database, demonstrating accuracy and relevance.
3.  **Deliver a functional codebase** and initial architecture that can be scaled in subsequent phases.
4.  **Present a strategic roadmap** outlining the next phases for the prototype's evolution into a fully integrated Knowledge Centre.

#### **3. Key Objectives & Success Indicators**

| **Obj.** | **Outcome** | **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **O1** | Functional AI agent prototype. | Prototype delivered and formally accepted by the upu Project Manager. |
| **O2** | Knowledge base validation. | The agent correctly answers a pre-defined set of test questions with an accuracy rate exceeding 90%. |
| **O3** | Roadmap for future phases. | Strategic roadmap document presented and discussed with the upu. |

#### **4. Scope of Work & Project Timeline**

This phase is designed to be agile and efficient, with an estimated duration of 8 weeks.

#### **5. Remuneration**

The total fee for the complete execution of **Phase 1** of this project is **CHF 10,000 (ten thousand Swiss francs)**.

This is a fixed fee covering all activities and deliverables described in the previous section. Payment shall be made according to the terms established in the final consultancy agreement.

#### **6. Future Phases (Forward-Looking Vision - Not Budgeted)**

To achieve the complete vision of the PFS-KC, the following subsequent phases are proposed. The detailed scope, timeline, and budget for these phases will be developed upon the successful completion of Phase 1.

*   **Phase 2: Knowledge Base Expansion & Agent Enhancement.**
    *   Integration of additional data sources (e.g., legislation, upu statistics, reports).
    *   Development of advanced analytical capabilities, such as comparative regulatory analysis and compliance gap identification.
*   **Phase 3: UDP Integration & Pilot Testing.**
    *   Migration of the prototype's architecture to the Unified Data Platform (UDP) infrastructure.
    *   Execution of pilot tests with a select group of member countries and designated operators.
*   **Phase 4: Full Deployment & Continuous Maintenance.**
    *   Official launch of the PFS-KC to all authorized users.
    *   Establishment of a process for the continuous maintenance and updating of the data and the AI model.

#### **7. Dependencies and Assumptions**

The success and timeline of this project are contingent upon the following:

*   The upu will provide timely access to the initial database in a usable format at the project's outset.
*   The CHF 10,000 budget exclusively covers the consultancy and development services for Phase 1. It does not include cloud infrastructure costs, third-party software licenses, or AI model API consumption costs, which are assumed to be provided by the upu if required.
*   **Future UDP Integration:** It is important to note that the future integration with the upu's Unified Data Platform (UDP), envisioned for subsequent phases, is subject to the availability of the necessary technical resources from the upu. This includes, but is not limited to, the allocation of tokens for AI models, access to cloud services such as Amazon Bedrock, and the required access permissions. Any delays or unavailability of these resources could impact the timelines of future phases and are beyond the Consultant's control.

I appreciate the opportunity to present this proposal and am available to discuss it in further detail. I am confident that this initial project will demonstrate significant value and establish a solid foundation for the long-term success of the Postal Financial Services Knowledge Centre.

Sincerely,

**Edgar Barroso**
