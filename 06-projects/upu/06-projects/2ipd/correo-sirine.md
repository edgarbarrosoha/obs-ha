Dear Edgar and Oscar,

	I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that I’ve made a few updates on the shared drive:

- You’ll find the **second version of the 2IPD Methodology**, titled **“2IPD Methodology Notes V2.1 2025.pdf”**.  A **new bonus point has been introduced**, and **a few formulas have been revised**.
- In the folder **“2IPD Calculation > 2IPD final score > R scripts** **and** **results”**, I have updated the **R scripts** as well as the **generated outputs****.**
- Additionally, in **“2IPD_scorecard_project_AWS > R scripts”**, there is a **new R script** called **“Data R shiny preparation - year over year change.R”**, which prepares the **N-1 data** used in the R Shiny application.  
    The output files generated by this script can be found in the **Results** folder.
- The **R Shiny application has also been updated**. A new **“Year-over-year change”** **button** has been added, allowing users to compare current year (N) and previous year (N-1) data throughout the interface.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,

Sirine
