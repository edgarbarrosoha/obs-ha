# Expertise: Narrative Strategy

## Domain
Strategic narrative design for institutional transformation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Narrative as Movement Creator
A narrative that doesn't move to action is just a document. The goal is:
- **Cognitive shift** — Change how people think
- **Emotional resonance** — Connect to values
- **Behavioral change** — Inspire action

### 2. The NCM Narrative Framework

```
WHY (Purpose) → WHAT (Vision) → HOW (Bets) → WHO (You)
```

| Layer | NCM Content | Emotion Target |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| WHY | Don Eugenio's legacy, education transforms | Pride, purpose |
| WHAT | Campus 2030 as flagship | Aspiration |
| HOW | 3 bets (Distrito, Posgrados, Selectividad) | Clarity, confidence |
| WHO | Your role in making it happen | Agency, belonging |

### 3. Tension as Credibility
Narratives that ignore tensions feel like propaganda. Acknowledge:
- Resource constraints
- Political realities
- Competing priorities
- Historical failures

Then show how the plan addresses them.

### 4. Voices, Not Voice
A narrative gains power from multiple authentic voices:
- Leadership vision
- Faculty expertise
- Student aspiration
- Alumni proof

Weave quotes, don't just summarize.

## The 3 Transformational Bets

### Bet 1: Distrito de Innovación
**Narrative angle:** Space shapes behavior. The Distrito makes collaboration visible and friction-free.

**Key tension:** Physical investment vs. digital future
**Resolution:** Physical enables serendipity that digital can't replicate

### Bet 2: Posgrados Presenciales
**Narrative angle:** Graduate students are the glue between faculty research and industry needs.

**Key tension:** Undergrad focus vs. graduate investment
**Resolution:** Graduate excellence elevates undergraduate experience

### Bet 3: Selectividad
**Narrative angle:** Excellence requires curation. The right students, faculty, and programs.

**Key tension:** Growth vs. selectivity
**Resolution:** Quality attracts quality, creating virtuous cycle

## Evidence Types

| Type | Example | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| Proof point | Expedition program | "It already works" |
| Metric | % multi-school coauthorship | Measurable progress |
| Quote | Leadership verbatim | Authenticity |
| Story | Student transformation | Emotional connection |
| Benchmark | MIT, Stanford | Aspiration anchor |
