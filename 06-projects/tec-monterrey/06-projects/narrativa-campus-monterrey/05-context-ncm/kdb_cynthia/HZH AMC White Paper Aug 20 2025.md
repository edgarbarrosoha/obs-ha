## 3. Defining the Destination: Characteristics of a Leading Academic Medical Center

### 3.1. Definition of an Academic Medical Center

An Academic Medical Center (AMC) is a specialized institution that integrates clinical care, applied health research, and education under one unified mission. This tripartite structure is designed to advance medical knowledge, innovate healthcare delivery, and educate the next generation of healthcare professionals.

### 3.2. Academic Medical Center vs. Academic Health Center

TecSalud's aspiration for 2030 is to become a leading **Academic Medical Center** in Latin America, rather than a broader Academic Health Center (AHC) model.

**Key Distinctions:**

| Dimension | AMC | AHC |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Core Components | Medical school, teaching hospital(s), clinical research | Medical school, hospitals, nursing, pharmacy, public health, dentistry schools |
| Mission Focus | Clinical care, medical education, biomedical research | Interdisciplinary health education, research, population health |
| Governance | Leaner, led by medical/clinical leadership | Broader, university-based with multiple school deans |
| Flexibility | Easier to develop in stages | Requires broader, simultaneous capacity building |

The AMC model offers a more feasible, high-impact path forward for HZH.
