## Zone B: Consolidated Memory (Decisions, Patterns, Corrections)

### Decisions
- [2025-12] DEC: Central concept is "systemic collaboration" — curves that intersect, not parallel lines | WHY: Captures transformation essence | STATUS: active
- [2025-12] DEC: Three bets structure: Distrito, Posgrados, Selectividad | WHY: Leadership alignment | STATUS: active
- [2025-12] DEC: Don Eugenio as moral compass for narrative | WHY: Institutional resonance | STATUS: active
- [2025-12] DEC: Expedition as proof point | WHY: Shows concept already works | STATUS: active

### Patterns
- PAT:interview-to-hallazgo | Interview transcript → key findings extraction → narrative integration | REF: hallazgo-extraction.md
- PAT:multi-voice-synthesis | Collect quotes from multiple stakeholders → weave into coherent narrative | REF: narrative-revision.md
- PAT:tension-acknowledgment | Surface real trade-offs → address honestly → build credibility | REF: narrative principles

### Corrections
- [2025-12] COR: Initial narrative too abstract | LESSON: Add concrete metrics and examples
