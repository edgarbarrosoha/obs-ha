# Skill: Narrative Revision

**Trigger:** `\narrative [section]` or "revise narrative section [X]"

## Purpose
Revise and improve sections of the NCM 2030 narrative document, maintaining coherence with the overall vision and incorporating new insights.

## Protocol

1. **LOAD CURRENT VERSION**
   - Read `01-legacy-ncm/narrativas/ncm-2030-narrative.md`
   - Note current section structure
   - Identify section to revise

2. **GATHER INPUTS**
   - Check relevant hallazgos in `01-legacy-ncm/hallazgos/`
   - Review related interview quotes
   - Check indicator mapping in `05-context-ncm/`

3. **APPLY NARRATIVE PRINCIPLES**
   - Concrete over abstract — add data and examples
   - Real tensions — acknowledge trade-offs honestly
   - Don Eugenio as compass — ground in founding vision
   - Expedition as proof — reference what already works

4. **REVISE SECTION**
   - Maintain coherent narrative flow
   - Ensure connection to 3 bets (Distrito, Posgrados, Selectividad)
   - Balance aspiration with concreteness
   - Use voices from interviews where powerful

5. **QUALITY CHECK**
   - Does it move to action?
   - Is it grounded in evidence?
   - Does it resonate with Tec institutional voice?
   - Are trade-offs acknowledged?

6. **SAVE OUTPUT**
   - Update section in current narrative
   - Note changes in working memory
   - If major change, save previous version
