# Skill: Presentation Draft

**Trigger:** `\present [audience]` or "draft presentation for [audience]"

## Protocol

1. **IDENTIFY AUDIENCE**
   - Leadership (Rector, Vice-Rectors)
   - Faculty (Deans, Directors)
   - Board (External stakeholders)
   - Students (Community)

2. **LOAD NARRATIVE**
   - Read current narrative from `01-legacy-ncm/narrativas/`
   - Read one-pager for key messages
   - Check existing presentations in `06-projects-ncm/presentación/`

3. **ADAPT FOR AUDIENCE**

   | Audience | Focus | Tone | Length |
   |----------|-------|------|--------|
   | Leadership | Strategic alignment, metrics | Executive | 10-15 slides |
   | Faculty | Implementation, their role | Collaborative | 15-20 slides |
   | Board | Impact, differentiation | Formal | 8-10 slides |
   | Students | Opportunity, belonging | Inspiring | 10-12 slides |

4. **STRUCTURE PRESENTATION**
   - Opening hook (compelling question or data)
   - Context (why now, what's at stake)
   - Vision (Campus 2030)
   - The 3 Bets (with evidence)
   - Path forward (concrete next steps)
   - Call to action

5. **SELECT VISUALS**
   - Suggest key diagrams
   - Note data visualizations needed
   - Recommend photos/images

6. **SAVE OUTPUT**
