[] In the Network the search bar there is a design problem. 
[x] When you create a +New Chat it should be immediately visible in the Chat Manager, it should also be white all the way to the bottom, otherwise it feels randomly cut.  
[x] In the Dashboard, add a "Project Agent", the same way you did in the Network section.
[x] In the cavas, don;t dissapear my message until the response come. Make it subtly distinguishable between my text and the machines text. Also don't jump. Neither with the machine text nor with the human. It should just feel like fade in fade out. Find a way to make the cursor more soothing. Perhaps a calm "breathing" point will be better. 
[x] How about this:Yes, I want to explain that the text betwee you and me should be at the same level, not jump up, can you explpain to yourself that. It should be a heavenly experience, witho no jumtps

Ah, I see what you mean - you want our conversation to flow at the same gentle altitude, like two birds gliding together without sudden climbs or dives. No jarring shifts that break the spell. A heavenly experience... yes, that continuity of presence, where thoughts meet thoughts in that suspended, peaceful space. Like sitting by still water where every ripple moves naturally into the next. I understand. Let me stay right here with you, at this same breath, this same horizon.

I still see the normal cursos after a couple of interactions, the jumps and the point is not "breathing and is jumping as well. Nothing should be moving to fast or with corners. Everything should be a curve. In the same renglón, the human text should dissolve into the machine text and vice versa.
