**user**: What can you tell me about  the persnolity of the person whos runs this vault?
[Context: Notes: Ethics]
[Timestamp: 2025/10/27 10:25:24]

**ai**: Here’s a personality snapshot inferred from [[ethics]]:

- High-openness, systems thinker: Scans near- and long-term horizons (2025→2030), uses scenario design, and connects technical, social, and institutional angles.
- Highly conscientious and rigorous: Emphasizes study limitations, generalizability, methodology, measurement constraints (EEG vs fMRI), and careful claims. Dislikes sensationalism; corrects vocabulary misuse.
- Educator–facilitator mindset: Designs dialogue-centered sessions (circle format, no slides), sets clear norms (“listen to understand”), and evaluates process as much as product.
- Values-led and fairness-oriented: Prioritizes integrity, authorship, transparency, accountability, privacy, autonomy, and equity (e.g., concerns about profiling, explainability, and data rights).
- Techno-realist: Not anti-AI; supportive when used well, but vigilant about agency erosion, epistemic verification, and policy implications.
- Communication style: Nuanced, precise, reflective; uses memorable metaphors without hype; invites peer and public feedback.
- Context clues: Likely Spanish-speaking, academic/public policy environment (Tec de Monterrey, Escuela de Gobierno), comfortable bridging research and practice.

If you like, I can turn this into a concise “persona card” note with tags and link it to relevant project notes for quick reference.

One-liner
- Nuanced, rigorous educator–policy thinker who favors dialogue, fairness, and methodological care over hype.

Core values
- Integrity and authorship; transparency and accountability; privacy and autonomy; equity.

Strengths
- Systems thinking (near/long-term horizons).
- Methodological rigor (limitations, generalizability).
- Facilitative teaching; evaluates process as well as product.
- Techno-realist: pro-use, anti-sensationalism.

Communication style
- Precise, measured, metaphor-rich; sets norms (“listen to understand”).
- Prefers dialogue formats (circle, no slides); clear prompts.

What to avoid (triggers)
- Sensational terms: “stupid”, “dumb”, “brain rot”, “harm”, “brain damage”, “terrifying findings”.
- Overclaims like “brain scans,” “LLMs make you stop thinking,” “impact negatively” without evidence.

Decision style
- Evidence-bound, transparent about uncertainty and limitations.
- Seeks explainability, data rights, and accountable governance.

Active questions
- Ethics of predictive surveillance in education (autonomía, privacidad, estigma).
- Redefining “original” work with AI co-authorship; assessing process vs product.
- Protecting human judgment as AI agents become ubiquitous.

Operating contexts
- [[ethics]] (Tec de Monterrey, Escuela de Gobierno; syllabus/session design).
- Academic–public sector interfaces, policy design.

How to collaborate
- Bring options with trade-offs; cite limitations and generalizability.
- Show process transparency; include explainability and data stewardship plans.
- Evaluate thinking process, not just outputs.

Risks they watch
- Agency erosion via behavioral optimization.
- Epistemic verification breakdown (synthetic content chains).
- Augmented-cognition inequality (“exocerebros”).
- Diluted responsibility in distributed decision systems.

Evidence links
- Session design, prompts, and vocabulary guidance: [[ethics]].

If that looks good, I’ll:
- Save as [[Persona - Vault Steward]] in a Personas folder you choose.
- Insert a “Related” link in [[ethics]] pointing to this card.

**user**: Create legacies based on the Horizons Architecture Framework for all project Folders
[Timestamp: 2025/10/27 10:28:52]

**ai**: Nice. Here’s a concrete way to implement “Legacies” for every project folder using a Horizons Architecture Framework. I’m giving you a ready-to-use template, a filled example for the Ethics folder, and two practical ways to bulk-create them across all project folders.

What you’re building
- For every project folder, create a legacy note that captures:
  - Horizon 1 (Near-term legacies)
  - Horizon 2 (Mid-term, transition/governance legacies)
  - Horizon 3 (Long-term, strategic/cultural legacies)
  - Cross-cutting concerns (data/privacy, documentation, governance)
  - Legacy metrics and indicators
  - Handover and sustainment plan
  - Artifacts to preserve
  - Stakeholders and accountability

Template: Legacy note structure
- Use this structure as a starting point. Replace <Project Name> and specifics with each folder’s details.

Note: You can put this in a file named “Legacy - Horizons.md” inside each project folder, or use a project-specific title like “Legacy – Horizons Architecture – <Project Name>”.

Template content (markdown)
Title: Legacy – Horizons Architecture – <Project Name>

# Legacy: Horizons Architecture Framework for Ethics

Overview
- Preserve the process-focused, ethics-first approach to AI in public policy and academia; ensure transparency, stakeholder engagement, and inclusive governance outlives the project timeline.

Horizon 1: Near-term legacies
- A documented workshop/playbook format that continues to be used (circle discussions, no slides)
- A living glossary of ethical terms and vocabulary to prevent sensationalism
- A repository of prompts, questions, and scenarios used in sessions
- Continuity: maintain a small facilitator team and a pulse-check mechanism
- Risks: staff turnover; mitigations include onboarding materials and a simple governance guide

Horizon 2: Mid-term legacies
- A policy/ethics framework adopted by the Escuela de Gobierno for AI projects
- Training modules for students and staff on AI ethics and governance
- A set of evaluation criteria for any AI-enabled policy work
- Handover: identify successors and update the glossary and case studies
- Metrics: number of trainings delivered, policy adoptions, feedback scores

Horizon 3: Long-term legacies
- Institutional culture of reflexive ethics in AI (norms, language, decision rights)
- Sustained governance mechanisms for AI projects
- Partnerships with external ethics bodies and research on responsible AI
- Dependencies: updated governance charter, ongoing funding for ethics activities

Cross-cutting legacies
- Data privacy and consent standards for projects using AI
- Documentation and training materials preserved in a central, searchable repo
- Governance playbook and escalation paths

Legacy metrics and indicators
- Participation rate in ethics sessions; retention of guidelines
- Number of policies influenced or adopted
- Quality of stakeholder feedback and demonstrated understanding
- Revisit cadence and revision history maintained

Handover and sustainment
- Responsible: Ethics Lead, with an appointed Governance Team
- Roadmap: annual refresh of ethics materials and a biennial review
- Training: quarterly refreshers; onboarding for new team members

Artifacts to preserve
- Session recordings and prompts; workshop materials; the glossary; governance documents; policy drafts

Data and privacy considerations
- Archive consent forms and de-identify any sensitive content in shared notes

Risks and mitigation
- Knowledge loss due to turnover; mitigations include a living, centralized legacy folder and onboarding guides

Reflection prompts
- In 12 months, would this legacy still support ethical AI practice in the domain? What would indicate success or failure?

How to implement across all project folders (two practical options)
Option A — Template-Driven (recommended with Templater)
- Create a single template file (Legacy Template) with the content above.
- In each project folder, create a file named “Legacy – Horizons.md” and run a templating command to fill <Project Name> and <Folder Path> automatically.
- If you’re using the Templater plugin, you can set up a small template macro that reads the folder name and path and inserts them into the front matter and content automatically.

Option B — Manual per-folder creation (no plugins)
- Copy the template for each project folder.
- Replace <Project Name> and path fields with the actual values.
- Save as Legacy – Horizons.md (or Legacy.md) in the project folder.
- Create a top-level index note (e.g., [[Legacies Index]]) with links to each project’s Legacy note.

Bulk creation script (conceptual)
If you want me to draft a small script, here’s a conceptual outline. Run in the vault root (adjust paths as needed).

- Node.js example (pseudocode):
  - root = "Git-Obs-HA/06-Projects"
  - for each folder under root that represents a project:
    - if folder contains a README or a known marker, set projectName from folder name
    - create file at "<folder>/Legacy – Horizons.md"
    - write the template with projectName and folder path substituted

- Python example (similar logic):
  - walk the directory tree
  - for each leaf folder that matches project criteria, write Legacy file with substituted values

Two quick wins to start
- Create one Legacies Index note listing all projects and linking to their Legacy notes.
- Add a minimal Horizon 1 entry to each Legacy note first; then fill Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 progressively.

Would you like me to:
- Provide a ready-to-paste “Legacy – Horizons” note for a specific project folder you name?
- Or draft a small, ready-to-run script (Node.js or Python) tailored to your vault structure to generate Legacy notes for all project folders automatically?
- Or set up a Master Legacies Index note and show how to bulk-link all project Legacies into it?
