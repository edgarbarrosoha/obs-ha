Below is a curated set of seminal works on collective intelligence (CI) and on the use of AI to enable CI at very large scale, with emphasis on platforms and deployments that have reached millions of people or have been used nationally or supra‑nationally. An artifact table summarizing titles, contributions, scale, and AI roles is embedded.

Foundational theory and measurement

- Surowiecki, The Wisdom of Crowds. Established conditions for crowd accuracy (diversity, independence, decentralization, aggregation), anchoring much of the modern CI literature (theory). (1.1)
- Hong & Page, Diversity vs. ability. Formalized the epistemic value of cognitive diversity in group problem‑solving (theory). (2.1)
- Woolley et al. and Malone, Collective intelligence factor. Demonstrated a measurable group‑level c‑factor predicting performance across tasks; later meta‑analytic support refined the construct (measurement). (3.1)
- Engelbart, Augmenting the Human Intellect. Early socio‑technical vision for augmenting “collective IQ” with interactive computing; foundational to the design of CI platforms (theory/platform foundations). (4.1)

Platforms and methods that operate at mass scale

- Wikipedia and peer production. A globally scaled, self‑organizing knowledge commons and a canonical CI platform; contemporary overviews report continual high‑velocity activity (e.g., ~1.8 edits/second, multi‑million page creation), illustrating sustained mass participation. (5.1)
- Zooniverse/Galaxy Zoo citizen science. A leading CI ecosystem engaging very large volunteer cohorts; reported to have nearly or over two million users, producing labeled data and discoveries across domains. (5.1)
- Prediction markets (Iowa Electronic Markets, etc.). Markets as CI mechanisms for forecasting; widely studied and deployed for election/economic prediction and decision support. (4.1)
- Participatory budgeting (PB). An institutionalized participatory method that has diffused to roughly 3,000 cities worldwide, demonstrating population‑scale civic input into public finance (method/platform). (4.1)
- Decidim (Barcelona and beyond). Open‑source participatory democracy infrastructure supporting proposals, consultations, and PB; Barcelona’s processes document large municipal participation figures and formalization within city governance. (4.2)

AI‑mediated collective deliberation and policy synthesis

- Pol.is and vTaiwan. Pol.is scales deliberation through statistical summarization and opinion‑space mapping; deployments span municipal and national contexts. vTaiwan, a government‑backed process in Taiwan, used Pol.is to engage over 200,000 citizens in its first five years and inform national laws; typical Pol.is engagements range from hundreds to tens of thousands of participants. (6.1, 7.1)
- Collective Dialogue Systems (CDS) overview. A synthesis of AI‑enabled functions for large‑scale public dialogue: moderation (toxic speech detection), clustering/mapping, summarization, preference aggregation, and facilitation support; reports deployments where thousands of statements and millions of votes have been processed (e.g., Polis). (8.1, 8.2, 8.3)
- Generative AI for pro‑democracy platforms. Documentation of early, practical genAI integrations for deliberation platforms: translation, toxicity flagging, drafting assistants, ML‑based summarization and visualization, and algorithmic ranking to surface consensus‑building content. (6.1, 6.2)
- AI in democratic innovations (mini‑publics and beyond). Analyses cataloguing AI functions—translation, summarization, clustering, generation of questions/counter‑arguments, and facilitation—to scale deliberation while preserving deliberative quality. (9.1)

How these strands relate at the scale of millions of citizens

- Theories of crowd accuracy and cognitive diversity (Surowiecki; Hong & Page; Woolley/Malone) underpin mass platforms such as Wikipedia and Zooniverse, which engage populations at, or easily scaling to, millions and produce data used by AI systems. (1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 5.1)
- Civic platforms and methods—PB, Decidim, and prediction markets—demonstrate institutional uptake and sustained scaling across cities and polities; they constitute building blocks for national or transnational CI. (4.1, 4.2)
- AI‑enabled CDS, notably Pol.is, have demonstrated national‑level policy impact (vTaiwan) and repeated engagements with thousands to tens of thousands of participants, processing millions of votes—suggesting pathways to organize and synthesize input from very large populations. (6.1, 8.1, 7.1)

Notes on evidence coverage and limitations

- Explicit “millions of participants” are best documented for Wikipedia and Zooniverse; CDS reports typically cite thousands to tens of thousands per engagement with repeated use across jurisdictions, rather than single events with millions, but they are integrated in national processes (e.g., vTaiwan). (5.1, 6.1, 8.1, 7.1)
- For AI roles, current evidence supports augmentation—moderation, summarization, mapping, facilitation, translation—rather than fully automated deliberation; governance and legitimacy considerations remain active research topics. (8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.1)

Overall, these works collectively establish the intellectual foundation (crowd accuracy, diversity, c‑factor, augmentation), demonstrate platforms and methods that have already reached mass scale (Wikipedia, Zooniverse, PB), and document AI‑enabled deliberation systems (Pol.is and broader CDS) that have operated at municipal to national levels and are designed to scale to very large populations. (1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 4.2, 6.1, 8.1, 7.1)
