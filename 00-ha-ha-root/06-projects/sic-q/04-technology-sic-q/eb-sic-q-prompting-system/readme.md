Documentation, prompts, and research for the SIC-Q (Sistema de Inteligencia Colectiva de Queretaro) project and related materials used by Arquitectura de Horizontes (HA). This repo is primarily a knowledge base and prompt library, not an application.

## Overview

SIC-Q is an AI-assisted collective intelligence system concept designed to scale citizen participation for state planning. The materials here capture:
- A consolidated definition of the system and architecture
- Citizen journey prompts and diagrams
- Global benchmarks and references
- Proposal prompts and interview assets
- Source documents, transcripts, and PDFs

## How to navigate

1. Start with `sic-q-definition/sic-q-definition.md` to understand the system, phases, and technical framing.
2. Use `citizens-journey/diagrama-mermaid-v01.mmd` to render the citizen flow, then pair with `citizens-journey/citizens-journey-v01.md` for narrative output.
3. Review `benchmarks/benchmarks.md` to ground the project in global precedents and lessons.
4. Use `propuesta/propuesta.md` as a base prompt when drafting a client proposal.
5. Dive into `doc-knowledge/` and `transcripts-zooms/` for source material and interview context.

## Notes
