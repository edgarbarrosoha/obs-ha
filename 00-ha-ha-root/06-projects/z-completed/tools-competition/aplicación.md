# Proposal abstract *
Describe your proposed tool. We want to understand how it works, how it reaches the learner populations and learning outcomes relevant to your track, and how the technology functions.

Students often struggle to connect their academic studies to real-world careers. To make informed decisions about a major or career path, students may benefit from vocational guidance and transdisciplinary experiences. The HA Hybrid Intelligence Project-Based Vocational Platform addresses this gap by offering personalized guidance through a human-AI peer-to-peer network. It fosters a self-evolving support ecosystem that integrates human mentorship, hybrid intelligence, and collaboration among educators, institutions, and AI-driven multi-agent systems.

The platform facilitates individualized learning and teamwork through project-based initiatives, empowering students to explore talents, understand vocational aspirations, and bridge personal growth with collective innovation.

The platform is built on the Horizons Architecture (HA) framework, which is powered by six multidimensional AI agents: Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects. These AI agents collaborate with human mentors, educators, and peers, forming a hybrid support network enriched by a generative ontology of sub-agents to provide personalized guidance.

Imagine Sam, unsure about their future career. Through the platform Sam:

Explores long-term goals (**Legacy AI**).
Connects with human-machine mentors and peers (**Community AI**).
Accesses personalized educational resources (**Learning AI**).
Discovers relevant tools and technologies (**Technology AI**).
Gains insights into industry trends (**Context AI**).
Engages in hands-on projects with peers (**Projects AI**).

As Sam engages, the platform identifies a growing interest in renewable energy and generates a specialized **Renewable Energy Sub-agent**, offering targeted resources, projects, and professional connections. This dynamic feedback loop refines Sam's learning pathway. Through transdisciplinary projects and collaboration, Sam gains practical experience and clearer career understanding.

In partnership with education ministries and institutions like tec-monterrey, the platform aims to integrate into 100 schools, impacting 20,000 students in its first year. Focused on equity, it provides personalized scholarships, mentorship, and resources, especially for first-generation college applicants. Continuous progress monitoring offers data-driven insights to refine teaching strategies. By linking curricula to real-world skills, the platform improves student outcomes and supports teachers' professional development.

The HA platform utilizes:
- **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**: Enabling accessibility and scalability.
- **HA Framework**: Combining pre-defined AI taxonomy structures with a dynamic adaptive ontology evolving with user input.
- **Support for Transdisciplinary Projects**: Enabling scalable, interdisciplinary learning and skill development.
- **Collective Intelligence Growth**: Builds an ever-growing support hybrid intelligence network as more students and educators engage.

Students often struggle to link academics with real-world careers. High school students need vocational guidance to choose a major or a career path. Unfortunately, transdisciplinary opportunities for exploring career options are limited. The HA Hybrid Intelligence Project-Based Vocational Platform addresses this by offering personalized and collaborative vocational and academic guidance through a human-AI peer-to-peer network. The platform creates a self-evolving support ecosystem by integrating human mentorship, hybrid intelligence, and transdisciplinary collaboration between educators, institutions, and AI-driven multi-agent systems. It offers learning tailored to individual needs while fostering teamwork and collective experiences through project-based initiatives. This hands-on, transdisciplinary approach enables users to explore their talents, develop a vocational understanding of their life vision, and bridge personal growth with collective innovation, guiding them toward meaningful academic and career choices.

This hybrid support network is built upon the Horizons Architecture (HA) framework, which is powered by six AI dimension agents—Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects—that guide students through their vocational journey. These agents interact with mentors, educators, and peers, creating a generative ontology of sub-agents that deliver adaptive, personalized support. By integrating academic learning with hands-on, project-based experiences, this system not only enhances resource access and career exploration for all students but places a special emphasis on empowering underrepresented groups, seeking equitable opportunities for personal and professional growth.

**How It Works**

Imagine Sam, a student unsure about future career paths. Upon accessing the HA Project-Based Vocational Platform, Sam begins interacting with the six AI agents designed to guide their vocational journey:

- The **Legacy Agent** helps Sam identify long-term goals by exploring personal interests, values, and aspirations.
- The **Community Agent** connects Sam with mentors, educators, and peers who share similar interests, fostering a supportive network.
- The **Learning Agent** provides personalized educational resources tailored to Sam's academic needs and learning style.
- The **Technology Agent** introduces tools and technologies relevant to Sam's areas of interest.
- The **Context Agent** offers insights into industry trends and real-world applications of skills across various fields.
- The **Projects Agent** suggests hands-on projects aligned with Sam's interests, promoting practical skill development.
    
As Sam engages with these agents, the platform recognizes a growing interest in renewable energy. In response, it generates a specialized **Renewable Energy Sub-agent**, offering targeted resources, transdisciplinary project opportunities, and connections with professionals in that field. This dynamic process creates a feedback loop where human input and AI adaptability work together to refine Sam's learning pathway.
