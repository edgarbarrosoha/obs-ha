**[[00.1 Navigating Escalating Complexity. The Need for New Human-Machine Frameworks]]**

Complexity is an inherent part of life, manifesting in every corner of our existence. As problems become more complex, they span multiple domains and involve many stakeholders, making coordinating efforts and finding sustainable courses of action difficult. In this perspective, individuals and organizations (Governments, companies, NGOs, educational institutions, etc.) may benefit from incorporating system thinking frameworks to provide a structured approach to problem-solving, opportunity seizing, and decision-making. Enabling users to analyze a network of agents and break down complex issues into manageable parts could enhance their cognitive and actionable capacities. By utilizing these frameworks, users could more effectively identify the critical factors contributing to the project's complexity and prioritize their efforts accordingly. Additionally, system thinking frameworks can help identify potential solutions and evaluate their trade-offs while mitigating the risk of unintended consequences, such as negative externalities.

However, as powerful as systems thinking frameworks are, when it comes to complex phenomena, they may need to catch up due to the amount of data, agents, and processing involved in a complex endeavor. Therefore, incorporating AI and computational techniques might be necessary to unlock the full potential of individuals and organizations when tackling wicked efforts. The paradox is that we live in an era where data and technology surround us. Nevertheless, it is still difficult for most individuals and organizations to leverage AI and advanced computational techniques. This disconnection may be due to lack of training, database access, and data processing power to utilize these technologies effectively. AI and advanced computational techniques can arguably complement and enhance human cognitive capacities, such as critical, creative, and systems thinking, by processing, generating, and analyzing large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This human-machine symbiosis enables individuals and organizations to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions to address complex challenges efficiently and sustainably. Likewise, by providing objective and data-driven insights, computational techniques and AI can help individuals and organizations overcome cognitive biases, such as confirmation or anchoring biases. The potential value of data utilization is widely recognized across various sectors and locations. Still, most individuals and organizations require more methods, data structures, and processing power to utilize data in complex endeavors effectively.

Furthermore, many of these wicked problems require intense transdisciplinary collaboration. Therefore, transdisciplinary methods also aid individuals and organizations in their thought processes and applied techniques (human and computational) when facing complex endeavors. Transdisciplinary approaches involve bringing together people with diverse perspectives, knowledge, and skills from various disciplines to solve problems or seize opportunities collaboratively. For example, transdisciplinary research is crucial to effectively addressing climate change, which involves complex interactions between natural systems, human behavior, and socio-economic factors. There is evidence that multidisciplinary teams are more effective at problem-solving than homogeneous teams because they bring diverse perspectives and knowledge. In addition, complex endeavors also need to be conceptualized for scalability and coordination among transdisciplinary users in ever-evolving contexts and challenges. In this context, Horizons Architecture (HA) seeks to provide a systematic and integrated system thinking framework, drawing on various system theories, computational methods (AI, NLP, ML, etc.), and transdisciplinary approaches to break down complex challenges. HA proposes a taxonomy for complex general-purpose endeavors consisting of two axes (time and simultaneous complexity) and six dimensions (Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects). The HA framework consists of a system thinking framework, a HA AI & data system, and an HA collaborative fractal network that can function as stand-alone or interconnected components, all based on the same structure. The following section will describe the importance of the HA system framework, its dimensions, axes, and three stand-alone components.
