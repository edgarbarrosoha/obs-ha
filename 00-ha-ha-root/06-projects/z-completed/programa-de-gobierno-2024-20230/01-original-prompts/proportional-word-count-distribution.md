**Input Gathering:**
1. **Document Type Identification:**
• “What type of document are you working on? (e.g., academic paper, business proposal, report, blog post, white paper, etc.)”

2. **Structure Identification:**
• “Do you have an outline or structure for this document? If so, please provide the sections. If not, would you like suggestions based on common best practices for your document type?”

3. **Total Word Count:**
• “What is your desired total word count for the document? (If you’re unsure, I can suggest a range based on your document type.)”

4. **Section Customization (if applicable):**
• “Are there any sections that you believe should have more or fewer words based on their importance or focus? You can adjust percentages if needed, or I can follow best practices.”

**Action: Proportional Word Count Calculation**
Based on the document type, structure, and total word count, create a proportional word count distribution for each section.
1. **Document Type Recognition:**
• “For a [document type], the common total word count range is typically between [suggested range], with the following best practices for section breakdown:”

2. **Outline-Based Distribution:**
• “Given your outline/structure, I will distribute your desired word count of [total word count] as follows:”
**Example Output for Academic Paper (4500 words):**
• Abstract: 5% → 225 words
• Introduction: 15% → 675 words
• Literature Review: 20% → 900 words
• Methods: 15% → 675 words
• Results: 20% → 900 words

• Discussion: 15% → 675 words

• Conclusion: 10% → 450 words

3. **Adjustment Option:**
• “Would you like to adjust the word distribution based on your preferences or keep the default?”

**Final Output:**
Provide a clear breakdown of the document’s proportional word count by section, including the flexibility to modify sections based on user input or field-specific best practices.
