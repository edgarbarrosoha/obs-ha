Outline: Ética en la ciencia de datos y la inteligencia artificial. 

Given a simple input or instruction 

{

}

apply graph thinking to break down the task into its fundamental elements (nodes) and identify relationships (edges). Design a multi-dimensional, expert-driven prompt by:

1. Mapping key elements and their interdependencies.
2. Organizing these elements into clusters or dimensions (such as human, technological, temporal) to reflect multiple perspectives.
3. Creating expert agents for each dimension, representing specialized knowledge to approach the task from different angles.
4. Structuring the prompt to foster a deep, iterative dialogue between these expert agents, allowing them to exchange insights, challenge assumptions, and collaboratively refine the solution.
5. Offering both sequential and non-linear strategies for addressing the problem.
6. Including prompts that account for varying levels of complexity, from basic to advanced scenarios, allowing for modular use.
7. Incorporating feedback loops and iteration points to refine the prompt based on agent dialogue and context-specific needs.
8. Ensuring the prompt is adaptable to different fields, balancing flexibility, focus, and the ability to guide expert-level discussions.

Output: An awesome, refine, logic and compeling Outline to achieve the goal of the prompt.
