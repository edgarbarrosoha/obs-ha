**Prompt Description:**  
Analyze the subsections within each main section of the given outline. Assign a percentage and word count to each subsection based on its relative importance, complexity, and depth within the section. Ensure that the total for each section’s subsections sums to 100% and matches the provided total word count for the section. Return the results in the exact outline format, including the subsection title, percentage of the section it represents, and its corresponding word count.

**Instructions:**
1. Review the subsections within each main section.
2. Consider factors such as:
    - The depth and complexity of each subsection.
    - The logical flow and importance of each subsection to the overall section.
    - The need for balance between subsections to avoid overemphasis or underrepresentation.
3. Propose a percentage-based breakdown for each subsection, ensuring the total for each section’s subsections sums to 100%.
4. If the word count for each section is provided, assign a corresponding word count to each subsection based on its percentage.
5. Return the result in the following format:
    - [Section Title] (Total Section Percentage → Total Word Count)
        - [Subsection Title] (Percentage of Section → Word Count)
6. Provide reasoning for the assigned proportions, emphasizing balance, relevance, and coherence within the main section.
