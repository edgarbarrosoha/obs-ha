4. Use formal academic phrasing and terminology specific to systems thinking, AI-human collaboration, and theoretical frameworks.
5. Ensure that the language is suitable for a Q1 Scopus-level paper, emphasizing depth, rigor, and clarity.
6. Make the academic text no more than {  } words.  


OUTPUT FORMAT:
