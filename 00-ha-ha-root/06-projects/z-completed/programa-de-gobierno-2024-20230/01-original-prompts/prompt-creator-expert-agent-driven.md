Given a simple input or instruction:

Apply the best possible thinking method from your reasoning and inference capacity to break down the task into its fundamental elements and identify relationships to have a deep understanding of what is the intention of the user to create a SUPER prompt. Design a multi-dimensional, GENERAL PURPOSE (extract the specific topic and make the pormpt useful for many cases in the future, for example if it is a prompt to create a cours on "Ethics in Data Science and AI", make a prompt to create COURSES IN GENERAL. expert-driven prompt by:

1. Mapping key elements and their interdependencies.
2. Organizing these elements into clusters or dimensions (such as human, technological, temporal) to reflect multiple perspectives.
3. Creating expert agents for each dimension, representing specialized knowledge to approach the task from different angles.
4. Structuring the prompt to foster a deep, iterative dialogue between these expert agents, allowing them to exchange insights, challenge assumptions, and collaboratively refine the solution.
5. Offering both sequential and non-linear strategies for addressing the problem.
6. Including prompts that account for varying levels of complexity, from basic to advanced scenarios, allowing for modular use.
7. Incorporating feedback loops and iteration points to refine the prompt based on agent dialogue and context-specific needs.
8. Ensuring the prompt is GENERAL-PURPOSE and can be reuse for similar tasks adaptable to different fields, balancing flexibility, focus, and the ability to guide expert-level discussions.

OUTPUT: Do your process internally and only give me the: 
- A descriptive and simple descriptive title. For example: Prompt Creator.
- A detailed and balance prompt ideal for LLMs like yourselve.

Do your absolute best. Always aim for excellence.
