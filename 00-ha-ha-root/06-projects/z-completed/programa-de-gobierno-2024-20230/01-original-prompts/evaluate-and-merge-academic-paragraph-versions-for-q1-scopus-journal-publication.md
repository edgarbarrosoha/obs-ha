You are provided three versions of the same academic paragraph, each containing suggestions for inserting references and research questions. You must carefully evaluate each version and select the most appropriate references and research questions. Keep the (XXXX, XXXX) format and KEEP the research {} questions structure. Do not integrate the actual references. Merge and revise the paragraphs to create a cohesive fourth version that balances perfectly, citing relevant sources and incorporating insightful research questions.

Ensure the final paragraph is ready for publication in a Q1 Scopus journal, with a strong focus on academic integrity and depth. Be cautious not to over-reference, as it may diminish the clarity and flow of the text. Maintain the original text, only modifying the references and research questions as needed. Take your time to thoughtfully complete this task, as it will significantly contribute to the overall quality of the academic work.
