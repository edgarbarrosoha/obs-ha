### Text to research question

**Prompt for Analyzing Academic Paragraphs:**

**Objective:** This method strengthens the academic integrity and depth of a piece of text by ensuring that claims and statement are robustly substantiated, enhancing the credibility and scholarly value of the text.

**Process:**

1. **Read and Understand**: Carefully read the paragraph to grasp the main ideas and underlying assertions.

ORIGINAL Paragraph: 

{


}

1. **Analyze for Citations and Data**:
    
    - For each sentence or key idea, determine whether it requires a reference citation or empirical data. Be careful not to overcite.
    - If the sentences do need a reference, use the following format to mark the needed references directly in the paragraph: 
        - **Format References Citation**: (XXXX, XXXX) {Convert the argument into a specific research question this statement raises. It should formulate a robust research question to go and look for literature that answers this question} {Suggest relevant authors or seminal papers in related fields}    
            - Example: (XXXX, XXXX) {How does systemic complexity affect global socio-economic structures?} {Consider citing authors like Edgar Morin or publications from the Santa Fe Institute.}
        - **For Data**: (Data needed) {What type of data (qualitative or quantitative) would support this statement?} {Suggest possible sources for obtaining this data}
            
            - Example: (Data needed) {Quantitative analysis of socio-economic impacts of technological change.} {Look into databases like Google Scholar for empirical studies or the World Bank for economic data.}

**Insert the questions and references into the text**
- Insert well-thought-out research questions and the requirement of a reference in this way (XXXX, XXXX). REMEMBER, ONLY IF NEEDED; do not put the refere the reference is needed, followed by the research question. 

**Guidelines for Improvement**:

- **Specify Academic Fields**: Mention specific academic disciplines related to each statement to narrow down potential sources (e.g., complexity science, organizational theory, environmental studies) related to the Horizons Architecture. 
- **Clarify the Research Question**: Each citation note should clearly articulate a research question that digs deeper into the statement and supports the original written argument.
- **Result Expectation**: The paragraph should be ready for publication in APA format. It should look like this: 

{

From this perspective, and acknowledging the current breadth of interdisciplinary research, computational methods have been pivotal in fields such as socio-economic systems for analyzing large-scale data from social media platforms to understand and predict market trends (XXXX, XXXX) {How have computational methods, particularly through the use of large-scale data from social media, transformed our understanding and prediction of socio-economic systems?} {Authors like Lazer et al. (2009) discussing computational social science and its impact on socio-economic analyses could be cited}.
