I have a draft idea that I'd like to develop further: 

{

}

Please expand this idea using a graph-thinking approach, where key elements are treated as interconnected nodes. Develop the concept by identifying these nodes (core elements, related ideas, challenges, opportunities, etc.) and illustrating the relationships between them (edges). Ensure the following:

1. Begin by identifying the core nodes of the idea.
2. For each node, explore how it relates to other key aspects of the concept.
3. Highlight any dependencies, constraints, or synergies between the nodes.
4. Ensure that these connections form a coherent, multi-dimensional understanding of the idea, reflecting different perspectives (e.g., strategic, technical, human, temporal).
5. Identify potential gaps or weak links in the graph and suggest ways to strengthen them.
6. Present the resulting thought structure in the following format:

Node 1 --> Connected to Node 2 (relationship) --> Node 3 (relationship) --> etc. Illustrate multi-dimensional relationships where necessary, and briefly summarize the overall structure and how the idea evolves through the connections.

And mermaid code.
