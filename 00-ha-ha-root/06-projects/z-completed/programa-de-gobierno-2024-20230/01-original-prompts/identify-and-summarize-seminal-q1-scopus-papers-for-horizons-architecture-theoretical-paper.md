This is my research questions: 

{

How can different stakeholders utilize complex systems frameworks in decision-making?


TASK 01: Look only for THE SEMINAL PAPERS from the most prestigious academic scholars and journals and make a list of the most:

- RECENT: {Year of publication}
- MOST CITED {Number of citations}
- Q1 SCOPUS only Q1 Scopus academic papers (Yes/No)

That better addresses the research question and supports the argument. Make a rank list from MOST fitting (1) to the less fitting answer to the research question: 

TASK 02: After giving me the list, write a summary that explains
 the references synthetically. 

{


}

Just as an example, the format should look EXACTLY likes this, so that it is a connected summary of the paper's ideas like this: 
{
A range of studies provide empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of hybrid human-machine intelligence frameworks in managing system complexities. Zou (2024) and Ye (2022) both highlight the importance of balance and integration in these systems, with Zou emphasizing the need for a threshold to optimize performance, and Ye proposing a parallel cognition approach. Trianni (2023) and Sherson (2023) further explore the potential of hybrid collective intelligence and a multi-dimensional framework for developing and deploying AI-human systems.
