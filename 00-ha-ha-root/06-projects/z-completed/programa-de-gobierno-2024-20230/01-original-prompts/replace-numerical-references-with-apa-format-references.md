Empirical evidence from various studies underscores the effectiveness of hybrid human-machine intelligence frameworks in managing increased systemic complexity across different domains. In the realm of strategic organizational decision-making, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to support the dynamic process characterized by uncertainty, although it necessitates a reevaluation of human-machine roles and an emphasis on education to leverage these technologies effectively [1]. Similarly, in smart manufacturing, human-robot collaboration (HRC) demonstrates significant improvements in operational flexibility and productivity through context-aware human action recognition and prediction, highlighting the potential of AI to enhance collaborative workspaces [2]. Research on hybrid systems combining human and machine predictions reveals that such integrations can outperform either human or machine predictions alone, especially when accounting for the unique expressions of confidence by both parties [3]. This is echoed in the context of pandemic response within small and medium enterprises (SMEs), where an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance has shown to facilitate prompt and informed decision-making, thereby assisting in business sustainability [4]. In healthcare, the application of conversational agents for clinician collaboration points to the necessity of addressing challenges such as trust, transparency, and ethics to fully realize the benefits of hybrid intelligence [5]. Further evidence from predictive maintenance studies emphasizes the importance of keeping both individual workers and entire organizations "in the loop" to ensure the continuous and reliable functioning of AI-based socio-technical processes [6]. The Australian cotton industry's response to systemic uncertainty through inter-firm collaboration showcases how hybrid organizational forms and control processes can develop industry-level solutions, thereby managing complexity at a larger scale [7]. Studies on cultural transmission and problem-solving strategies suggest that algorithms with complementary biases to humans can temporarily boost performance, although human biases may limit the long-term preservation of algorithmic solutions [8]. The design of Hybrid Intelligence Systems (HIS) for critical tasks acknowledges the necessity of ongoing human supervision to mitigate the risks of system failures, highlighting the importance of a close partnership between humans and machines [9]. Lastly, in online customer service, hybrid approaches that integrate human feedback into Case-Based Reasoning cycles have proven superior in effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating the potential of combining human and artificial intelligence to refine problem-solving processes [10]. Together, these studies provide compelling empirical evidence that hybrid human-machine intelligence frameworks are effective in managing increased systemic complexity by leveraging the complementary strengths of both entities across various applications and challenges.
