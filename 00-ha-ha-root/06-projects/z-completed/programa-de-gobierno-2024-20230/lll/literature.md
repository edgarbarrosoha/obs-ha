What are the most effective lifelong learning models and practices according to the literature?

Lifelong learning is a dynamic and multifaceted process that is essential across various fields, including education, healthcare, and the digital economy. Effective lifelong learning models and practices are characterized by their adaptability, focus on self-directed learning, and integration of evidence-based techniques. The literature highlights several key models and practices that are particularly effective in fostering lifelong learning.

## Self-Directed Learning and Heutagogy

- Heutagogy emphasizes self-determined learning, where learners take control of their educational journey, setting their own goals and determining how to achieve them. This approach is particularly effective in contexts where flexibility and adaptability are crucial, such as in rapidly changing professional environments(Moore, 2020).
- Self-directed learning encourages individuals to engage in continuous personal and professional development, fostering a mindset that values growth and adaptability(Moore, 2020).

## Evidence-Based Learning Techniques

- Techniques such as active retrieval, spaced repetition, and interleaving have been shown to enhance knowledge retention and retrieval. These methods are grounded in cognitive psychology and are effective in both formal education and professional development settings(Tung & Matalon, 2023).
- Deliberate practice and maintaining a growth mindset are also critical components, encouraging learners to engage in challenging tasks and view failures as opportunities for growth(Tung & Matalon, 2023).

## The 60-Year Curriculum

- This model addresses the need for continuous learning throughout an individual's career, particularly in the digital economy. It emphasizes the integration of formal, nonformal, and informal learning experiences to adapt to technological advancements and changing job requirements(Bromber, 2021).
- The 60-Year Curriculum supports lifelong learning by providing structured opportunities for skill development and career advancement over an extended period(Bromber, 2021).

## Continuous Professional Development (CPD) in Healthcare

- In the medical field, CPD is crucial for maintaining competency and improving patient outcomes. Effective CPD models incorporate both structured and unstructured learning opportunities, addressing individual learning needs and promoting a culture of continuous improvement(Awuku, 2024).
- Strategies such as integrated electronic medical records (EMR) designs, personal learning projects, and practice updates are recommended to support lifelong learning in healthcare(Awuku, 2024).

While these models and practices are effective, challenges such as time constraints, resistance to change, and the need for cultural shifts in professional settings can hinder their implementation. Addressing these barriers requires a commitment to fostering a learning culture and providing support for learners to engage in lifelong learning activities(Awuku, 2024).

**How ​​are universities leveraging the use of AI in teaching and learning, and what are the documented benefits?**

Universities increasingly leverage AI in teaching and learning to enhance educational outcomes and streamline processes. AI technologies are being integrated into various aspects of education, from curriculum design to personalized learning experiences. The documented benefits include improved learning environments, personalized education, and enhanced engagement. These advancements are supported by frameworks and methodologies that guide the effective adoption of AI in academic settings. Below are key aspects of how AI is utilized and its benefits.

## Pedagogical Enhancements

- AI improves teaching and learning outcomes by creating interactive and immersive learning environments, such as simulations and virtual reality, which enhance student engagement and motivation(Namaziandost & Rezai, 2024).
- Generative AI tools, when combined with instructional design matrices, enable personalized and enriching educational experiences, tailoring content to individual student needs(Ruiz-Rojas et al., 2023).

## Operational and Governance Frameworks

- The AI Ecological Education Policy Framework addresses the integration of AI in universities through pedagogical, governance, and operational dimensions, ensuring stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities(Chan, 2023).
- A systematic approach is proposed for adopting Generative AI (GenAI) in curricula, which includes redesigning courses and defining evaluation metrics to measure success(Shailendra et al., 2023).

## Benefits in Science Education

- AI-powered tools in science education enhance learning environments, assist in creating quizzes, and predict academic performance, thereby improving learning outcomes(Almasri, 2024).

## Challenges and Considerations

- While AI offers numerous benefits, it also presents ethical, legal, and social challenges, including privacy and security concerns. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the responsible implementation of AI in education(Namaziandost & Rezai, 2024).

AI's integration into university teaching and learning offers significant benefits, including personalized learning and improved engagement. However, to ensure ethical and effective use, it is essential to address the associated challenges. Developing comprehensive frameworks and policies is vital to guide universities in leveraging AI responsibly and effectively.
