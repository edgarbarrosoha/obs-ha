---
1. Dimension: Legacy
What elements and best practices determine a government program's “what” and “why” to guide its strategic direction. 

What are the elements and best practices to elaborate a State Level (subnational) Government Program to establish a clear vision and effective strategic goals for their administration's term?


1. What are the best practices and critical success factors that allow converting a governor's leadership vision (proposed during the electoral contest) into a government program with consistent and transferable goals, promoting continuity and strengthening their administration?

What are the process recommendations for establishing a vision for a State Administration?

(Focused on identifying the key factors and justification behind the strategic definition of the program.)

How is the legacy of a government program conceptualized and operationalized in terms of continuity, sustainability, and institutional significance over time?
(Aimed at exploring the permanence and transfer of goals and objectives in successive administrations.)

1. Dimension: Community
What elements and best practices are integrated by the different actors—from population groups to institutions—to form the “who” participates in the government program, and how is their role in governance defined?
(Focuses on the identification and characterization of relevant actors in the formulation and execution of policies.)

How is the effectiveness of mechanisms for collaboration and citizen participation evaluated in the construction of social capital and the legitimacy of public policies at the state level?
(Directs the analysis toward the measurement and assessment of community participation and empowerment.)

1. Dimension: Learning

(It delves deeper into aspects of cybersecurity, technological resilience, and long-term viability.)

1. Dimension: Context
How do external factors—sociodemographic, political, and economic—affect “where” and “when” the policies of a government program are implemented, and what methodologies allow for a more precise contextual analysis?
(Examine how the environment is integrated into the definition and adjustment of government strategies.)

What foresight and risk management strategies are most effective in anticipating changes in the environment and ensuring the adaptability of government programs to future scenarios?
(Analyze the importance of medium- and long-term planning in the face of unforeseen changes or crises.)

1. Dimension: Projects
What criteria and methodologies for planning and executing projects allow the “why” of each initiative to be aligned with the strategic objectives of the government program, ensuring coherence and efficiency?
(Explore the link between specific projects and the general mission of the government program.)

How is the impact and success of public projects evaluated through measurable indicators and monitoring mechanisms, and how do these evaluation processes facilitate continuous improvement and accountability?
(Focused on measuring results, transparency, and feedback for future actions.)
