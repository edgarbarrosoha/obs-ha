You are absolutely correct to highlight the distinction between the Plan Estatal de Desarrollo (PED) and the Programa de Gobierno (PG). The PED is the long-term, aspirational vision, while the PG is the concrete, actionable plan for a 6-year administration. This nuance is crucial, and I will make sure the definitions are adapted with that in mind. Here's the revised approach:

**Revised HA Dimension Definitions for Government Programs (6-Year Context):**

1. **Legacy (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** The tangible and transferrable contributions that the Programa de Gobierno aims to make within its 6-year term, moving the state closer to the long-term vision set by the PED. This legacy focuses on establishing foundations for sustainable progress, initiating key projects, and creating policies or systems that will have a lasting positive effect beyond the current administration.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Alignment with the PED:** Clear connection to the long-term vision of the PED.
            
        - **Concrete Achievements:** Focus on achieving specific and measurable outcomes within 6 years.
            
        - **Initiatives for the Future:** Setting up projects, programs, or systems that will continue to benefit the state beyond the 6-year period.
            
        - **Transferable Value:** Creating value that can be maintained or expanded upon by future administrations.
            
        - **Foundational Progress:** Establishing a solid foundation for subsequent administrations to build upon, rather than aiming to solve all long-term issues within 6 years.
            
2. **Community (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** The network of stakeholders that the Programa de Gobierno will actively engage with during its 6-year term. The emphasis is on creating partnerships, enhancing social capital, and ensuring that diverse perspectives contribute to program effectiveness within the specific timeframe. The intention is not just to map, but to foster a collaborative environment.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Targeted Stakeholder Engagement:** Identifying key stakeholders whose participation is critical for the success of the programs within the 6-year period.
            
        - **Active Collaboration:** Establishing mechanisms for ongoing dialogue, feedback, and joint problem-solving.
            
        - **Strengthened Social Capital:** Building trust and working relationships within the community to ensure smoother program implementation.
            
        - **Immediate Impact:** Focusing on how community engagement can lead to tangible results within the 6-year timeframe.
            
        - **Sustainable Mechanisms:** Creating participatory processes that can be continued by future administrations.
            
3. **Learning (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** The identification and enhancement of the specific knowledge and skills that government employees need to effectively implement the Programa de Gobierno during its 6-year term. The focus is on practical learning, data-driven approaches, and building institutional capacity to achieve immediate program goals and to create a better working environment.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Targeted Capacity Building:** Focusing on skills development for immediate program needs.
            
        - **Data-Driven Approach:** Developing skills in data analysis and evidence-based decision-making to measure program effectiveness.
            
        - **Practical Learning:** Integrating training into the daily operations of the administration, using learning by doing.
            
        - **Institutionalization:** Creating systems that preserve knowledge gained during this administration, and transfer learnings to future administrations.
            
        - **Measurable Learning Outcomes:** Ensuring that learning translates to improved performance and delivery within the administration.
            
4. **Technology (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** The selection and implementation of practical technologies that directly support the achievement of the Programa de Gobierno’s objectives within its 6-year term. Focus is on implementing technologies with immediate positive impact and scalability, emphasizing efficient, user-friendly systems that can improve government services and promote transparency.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Priority Technologies:** Focusing on technologies that support key program initiatives, such as digital platforms for services and data analytics systems.
            
        - **Feasible Implementation:** Selecting and implementing technologies that are readily deployable and user-friendly within the timeframe.
            
        - **Immediate Impact:** Emphasizing technologies that can have a quick and positive effect on service delivery and efficiency.
            
        - **Scalability:** Choosing solutions that can be scaled up to meet future needs.
            
        - **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:** Prioritizing technologies that can integrate into the state’s existing technology landscape.
            
5. **Context (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** A focused analysis of the socioeconomic, political, and environmental conditions of Guanajuato that are most relevant to the 6-year timeframe of the Programa de Gobierno. The goal is to identify critical factors that impact the administration’s ability to achieve its objectives within its mandate, with a focus on using contextual information to make informed adjustments during the 6-year administration, rather than a long term transformation.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Targeted Analysis:** Identifying the specific contextual factors that will impact program outcomes within the 6-year term.
            
        - **Immediate Relevance:** Focus on data and information that is most pertinent to the immediate challenges and opportunities of the state.
            
        - **Adaptability:** Designing programs that are flexible and can be adjusted based on real-time changes in the state.
            
        - **Resource Optimization:** Using contextual information to maximize the impact of resources and to avoid challenges that the context may have revealed.
            
        - **Regular Monitoring:** Setting up systems to monitor contextual changes and identify emerging issues.
            
6. **Projects (Government Program Context - 6-Year Focus):**
    
    - **Definition:** The specific, actionable activities that the government commits to undertaking within the 6-year timeframe of the Programa de Gobierno. These projects have clear objectives, defined resources, and detailed timelines, aligning with the administration’s short-term goals while contributing to the long-term vision articulated by the PED. Project management will focus on immediate results and tangible benefits.
        
    - **Key Elements:**
        
        - **Defined Scope:** Projects are clearly defined with specific goals, actions, and deliverables to be achieved within 6 years.
            
        - **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Prioritizing resources for projects with a high potential for immediate impact.
            
        - **Clear Timelines:** Setting realistic and achievable timelines to ensure project completion within the timeframe.
            
        - **Accountability:** Assigning clear responsibilities and setting up mechanisms to track progress and outcomes.
            
        - **Tangible Results:** Prioritizing projects that deliver measurable benefits to citizens within the 6-year term.
            

**Key Implications:**

- **Short-term Action, Long-term Vision:** These revised definitions emphasize the PG as a 6-year instrument that should be closely tied with the PED, while acknowledging the PG’s unique purpose as a set of achievable goals during an administration.
    
- **Practical Implementation:** The new definitions focus on implementing programs and systems that have realistic chances of success in the timeframe, making the plan actionable.
    
- **Focus on Impact:** There's a greater focus on achieving visible and meaningful impact within the administration’s term, with a constant eye on building foundations for the future.
    

By incorporating this understanding of the PED and the PG, we are aligning our analysis of global best practices and HA dimensions with the realities of government planning in Guanajuato.
