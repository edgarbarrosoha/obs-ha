Establishing a government vision and strategy involves a multifaceted approach that integrates scientific evidence, strategic planning, and effective communication. This process is crucial for addressing complex challenges such as public health crises, climate change, and sustainable development. The following sections outline key components and considerations for developing a comprehensive government vision and strategy.

## Integration of Scientific Evidence

- **Knowledge Translation**: Bridging the gap between research and policy is essential. This involves the synthesis and communication of research findings to inform decision-making, as emphasized by the World Health Organization's focus on knowledge translation to counter misinformation and promote evidence-based policies.
    
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilizing data-driven models can enhance the accuracy of predictions and inform strategic decisions. For instance, in the context of COVID-19, data-driven simulations have been used to optimize exit strategies by predicting the impact of public health interventions.
    

## Strategic Planning Frameworks

- **Complex Adaptive Systems**: Implementing systems like 'find, test, trace, isolate, and support' for COVID-19 requires a complex adaptive system approach. This involves rapid communication and coordination among various organizations to effectively manage public health responses.
    
- **Tiers of Service Framework**: Developing frameworks that categorize services into tiers can aid in operational and system planning. This approach has been used in healthcare to optimize service delivery and address gaps in care.
    

## Policy and Governance

- **Comprehensive Policy Development**: Addressing issues like climate change requires comprehensive policies that integrate legal, institutional, and management strategies. This is particularly important in sectors like agriculture, where governance must adapt to environmental challenges.
    
- **Strategic Health Purchasing**: Utilizing government budgets strategically can enhance health service delivery and progress towards universal health coverage. This involves aligning resource allocation with population health needs and addressing public financial management bottlenecks.
    

## Communication and Stakeholder Engagement

- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Engaging stakeholders in the development of strategic plans ensures that diverse perspectives are considered. For example, the NIDCD's strategic plan was developed in collaboration with stakeholders to prioritize scientific research and improve communication disorders.
    
- **Public Engagement and Education**: Ensuring public awareness and understanding of government strategies is crucial. This involves educating the public on health measures and the importance of compliance, as seen in the efforts to manage COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
    

While the establishment of a government vision and strategy is critical, it is also important to consider potential challenges and alternative perspectives. For instance, the rapid implementation of strategies during crises like COVID-19 can lead to conflicts between scientific advisors and political decision-makers, highlighting the need for effective communication and collaboration. Additionally, the economic implications of strategic decisions, such as lockdowns, must be carefully balanced with public health objectives to ensure sustainable recovery. These considerations underscore the complexity of developing a government vision and strategy that is both effective and adaptable to changing circumstances.

## Best Practices and Trends in Government Planning in Mexico: Insights from International Agencies

### Introduction

Effective government planning is crucial for achieving national development goals, particularly in countries like Mexico, where six-year government programs are a cornerstone of political and developmental strategies. International agencies such as CEPAL (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and the World Bank have played significant roles in shaping these practices. This response synthesizes the best practices and trends identified by these agencies, focusing on statewide government programs in Mexico.

### Strategic Alignment with International Agencies

International agencies have consistently emphasized the importance of aligning national development plans with global best practices. For instance, the OECD has influenced policymaking in Mexico through various mechanisms, including policy diffusion and transfer, over nearly three decades . Similarly, the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mexico (2014-2019) aligns with the National Development Plan (PND) 2013-2018, focusing on inclusive growth, productivity, and sustainability . These alignments ensure that Mexico's development strategies are integrated with global standards and priorities.

### Multi-Level Governance and Subnational Planning

One of the key trends identified by international agencies is the importance of multi-level governance in achieving development goals. The OECD has highlighted the need for effective coordination between federal and state governments in Mexico, particularly in areas such as innovation and competitiveness policies . Similarly, the World Bank has emphasized the role of subnational governments in implementing development programs, particularly in rural areas and social services .

### Focus on Innovation and Competitiveness

Innovation and competitiveness have been central to Mexico's development strategies, as recommended by international agencies. The OECD has promoted the creation of public-private councils at the subnational level to enhance productivity and competitiveness . These councils, known as State Productivity Commissions (CEPs), have been instrumental in identifying obstacles to development and implementing solutions tailored to regional needs . Additionally, the World Bank has supported initiatives to strengthen public sector innovation, emphasizing the need for embedding innovation in policy-making and administration .

### Emphasis on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction

International agencies have consistently highlighted the importance of social inclusion and poverty reduction in Mexico's development strategies. The World Bank's CPS for Mexico includes a strong focus on reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, with specific attention to ensuring access to basic social services for marginalized populations . Similarly, the OECD has emphasized the need for targeted interventions to address income inequality and improve the living conditions of indigenous communities .

### Strengthening Public Sector Capacity

Building the capacity of the public sector has been a recurring theme in the recommendations of international agencies. The OECD's Innovative Capacity Framework provides guidelines for making innovation an integral part of policy-making and administration, with a focus on improving the ability of governments to adapt to changing environments . The World Bank has also supported initiatives to strengthen public finances and improve government efficiency, particularly at the subnational level .

### Results-Based Public Administration

International agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of results-based public administration in achieving development goals. The OECD has promoted the use of performance budgeting systems, which align public expenditures with strategic objectives . Similarly, the World Bank has supported the implementation of results-based thematic engagement programs, which integrate financial, knowledge, and convening services to achieve development outcomes .

### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the progress made, several challenges remain in the implementation of government planning in Mexico. These include the need for greater coordination between federal and state governments, the limited impact of some social programs on poverty reduction, and the need for more robust mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation . International agencies have recommended addressing these challenges through enhanced strategic planning, improved governance structures, and greater involvement of civil society in the design and implementation of government programs .

### Conclusion

The insights from international agencies such as CEPAL, OECD, and the World Bank provide a comprehensive framework for effective government planning in Mexico. By aligning national development strategies with global best practices, strengthening multi-level governance, and focusing on innovation, social inclusion, and public sector capacity, Mexico can achieve its development goals and improve the well-being of its citizens.

Aligning Mexico's six-year government programs with global best practices involves adopting strategies that address public sector reform, education, anti-corruption measures, and sustainable development. International agencies recommend a multifaceted approach that includes management reforms, educational improvements, transparency, and alignment with global sustainability goals. These strategies are crucial for ensuring that Mexico's policies are effective and in line with international standards.

## Public Sector Reform and Management

- Public Financial Management/Internal Control (PFM/IC) reforms should be seen as both management and technical reforms. This involves restructuring the civil service and ensuring that personnel management aligns with managerial approaches to reform implementation.
    
- Delegation within the public sector must be carefully managed to avoid inappropriate delegation that could hinder reform efforts.
    

## Educational Strategies

- The Mexican educational system has been evolving to meet the country's socio-economic needs. This involves implementing new educational plans and programs that are sometimes piloted alongside existing ones, which can cause confusion but are necessary for progress.
    
- Globalization demands that Mexico enhance its educational quality to improve national competitiveness. This involves adopting new educational theories and practices that align with global standards.
    

## Anti-Corruption Measures

- Addressing corruption is critical for aligning with global best practices. Mexico faces challenges with state capture and cooptation, which require legislative and regulatory reforms to combat corruption effectively.
    
- Transparency and accountability are essential components of governance. Mexico's participation in the Open Government Partnership aims to enhance citizen participation and accountability, although more progress is needed.
    

## Sustainable Development and Global Goals

- Mexico's strategic national programs, such as those by CONHACYT, should align more closely with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While there is some alignment, the relationship is not strong, indicating a need for more integrated approaches.
    
- Environmental management, particularly in waste management, requires strategic national programs that align with international best practices to promote sustainable social development.
    

While these strategies provide a roadmap for aligning Mexico's government programs with global best practices, challenges remain. For instance, the complexity of implementing educational reforms amidst existing structures can lead to confusion, and the fight against corruption is hindered by systemic issues that require comprehensive legislative changes. Additionally, while efforts are made to align with global sustainability goals, the integration of these goals into national programs needs strengthening to ensure effective implementation.

International agencies recommend several key strategies for aligning Mexico's six-year State government planning, focusing on enhancing governance, combating corruption, and improving public administration. These strategies are crucial for ensuring that state-level plans are coherent with national and international standards, thereby promoting effective governance and sustainable development. The following sections outline the primary strategies recommended by international agencies, as derived from the provided research contexts.

## Governance and Regulatory Quality

- International agencies emphasize the importance of improving governance and regulatory quality as a foundation for effective state planning. This involves adopting practices from successful administrations, such as those during the presidencies of Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox, and Felipe Calderón, which were associated with positive governance outcomes(Fragoso, 2023).
- The use of governance indicators and models is recommended to assess and enhance the effectiveness of public administration, ensuring that state plans align with broader governance goals(Fragoso, 2023).

## Combating Corruption

- Addressing corruption is a critical strategy for aligning state government planning. The pervasive issue of state capture and cooptation in Mexico necessitates robust anti-corruption measures. International agencies suggest that Mexico should incorporate comprehensive anti-corruption frameworks into its planning processes to enhance transparency and accountability(CARBALLO, 2023).
- The absence of explicit anti-corruption concepts in Mexican legislation highlights the need for legal reforms to support these efforts, ensuring that state plans are not undermined by corrupt practices(CARBALLO, 2023).

## Strategic Planning and Public Administration

- Strategic planning is essential for aligning state government initiatives with national and international objectives. This involves conducting thorough strategic analyses of political relations and leveraging strategic management tools to guide public administration effectively(Khikmatov, 2023).
- The diversity in internal regimes across Mexican states, as identified in the review of organic laws, suggests a need for standardized strategic planning frameworks that accommodate local contexts while adhering to federal guidelines(Vázquez et al., 2024).

## Security and Public Safety

- Enhancing public safety is a priority in state planning, with international agencies recommending the integration of security perceptions into legislative frameworks. This approach ensures that public safety is a central focus of state action, addressing historical neglect of this critical indicator(Lara, 2024).
- The strategy of concentrating security efforts in high-crime municipalities underscores the importance of localized approaches to public safety, which should be reflected in state planning(Zamora, 2022).

## Education and Social Development

- International agencies advocate for the inclusion of education and social development strategies in state planning. The adaptation of educational strategies during the pandemic, such as remote learning and teacher training, exemplifies the need for flexible and innovative approaches in state plans(Benítez et al., 2024).
- Aligning educational policies with national development goals ensures that state plans contribute to broader social and economic objectives(Gutiérrez-Romero, 2023).

While these strategies provide a comprehensive framework for aligning Mexico's state government planning, challenges remain. The diversity of internal regimes and the prevalence of corruption pose significant obstacles to effective implementation. Additionally, the need for long-term planning and policy consistency is critical to overcoming these challenges and achieving sustainable development outcomes. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort from both national and international stakeholders to support Mexico's state governments in their planning endeavors.

# Elicit
Best Practices in Government Planning

## According to international agencies, effective government planning requires coordinated policy design, institutional capacity building, and evidence-based approaches, implemented through clear frameworks and equitable resource distribution.

# Abstract

International agencies prescribe practices that strengthen government planning by ensuring coordinated, participatory, and evidence-based policy design. Two OECD reports on urban and educational policies emphasize multi-level coordination and clear intergovernmental relations. The World Bank supports institutional capacity building through reforms—including strengthening centers of government, in-service training, and comprehensive policy approaches—and the use of strategic data and performance indicators in results-based management. Participatory mechanisms, such as deliberative budgeting in Brazil, and the inclusion of stakeholders’ perspectives, further anchor policy interventions.

Implementation, as detailed in these studies, requires well-defined institutional frameworks, effective communication channels, and equitable resource allocation. Political commitment, leadership, and capacity development emerge as key success factors, while challenges stem from bureaucratic silos, limited resources, and resistance to change.

# Insumos Estratégicos para el Programa de Gobierno de Guanajuato 2024–2030: Análisis de Fuentes Internacionales Recientes

## 1. Introducción

La formulación de programas de gobierno en el contexto actual exige un enfoque metodológico robusto que integre la complejidad de las dinámicas sociales, los avances tecnológicos y los entornos económicos interdependientes. Este documento tiene como propósito fundamental ofrecer insumos estratégicos para la elaboración del Programa de Gobierno de Guanajuato 2024–2030, adoptando un marco de análisis basado en la Arquitectura de Horizontes (HA) y complementado con herramientas de Inteligencia Artificial (IA). La incorporación de recomendaciones y experiencias provenientes de organismos internacionales se considera un elemento crucial para asegurar que el programa se fundamente en evidencia sólida y se alinee con las mejores prácticas a nivel global.

La Arquitectura de Horizontes (HA) proporciona una estructura para el análisis a través de seis dimensiones interrelacionadas: Legado, Comunidad, Aprendizaje, Tecnología, Contexto y Proyectos. Cada una de estas dimensiones permite examinar el diseño del programa desde perspectivas específicas, considerando tanto las lecciones del pasado como los desafíos y oportunidades del futuro. La metodología empleada en este análisis se centra en la revisión de informes y documentos oficiales publicados en los últimos cinco años por organizaciones internacionales clave como la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE), la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL), el Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina (CAF), el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para los Asentamientos Humanos (ONU-Hábitat), el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) y el Banco Mundial. La información extraída de estas fuentes se organiza y analiza en el marco de las dimensiones de HA para generar recomendaciones estratégicas aplicables al contexto de Guanajuato.

## 2. Metodología para la Identificación y Análisis de Fuentes

La identificación de las fuentes relevantes para este análisis se llevó a cabo mediante una estrategia de búsqueda que combinó palabras clave específicas relacionadas con las seis dimensiones de la Arquitectura de Horizontes y los temas centrales del programa de gobierno (gobernanza, planificación gubernamental, innovación pública, sostenibilidad, participación ciudadana, digitalización e inclusión). Se utilizaron los portales web de los organismos internacionales mencionados, aplicando filtros para asegurar que los documentos recuperados fueran informes o documentos oficiales publicados en los últimos cinco años.

Los criterios de selección para las 18 fuentes más relevantes se centraron en la aplicabilidad directa de su contenido a las dimensiones de HA y su pertinencia para los temas prioritarios del Programa de Gobierno de Guanajuato. Se priorizaron aquellos documentos que ofrecieran lineamientos técnicos, recomendaciones estratégicas y marcos de referencia concretos. El análisis de cada fuente se realizó con el objetivo de extraer información relevante para los tres niveles complementarios de cada dimensión de HA: el Elemento (concepto central), las Recomendaciones internacionales (orientaciones y experiencias comparables) y la Tendencia (lineamientos emergentes y dinámicas futuras). Este enfoque sistemático busca garantizar una cobertura exhaustiva y una evaluación rigurosa de la información recopilada.

## 3. Análisis de Fuentes Internacionales por Dimensión de HA

### 3.1 Dimensión Legado (Legacy)

Elemento: Visión a largo plazo y bienestar intergeneracional.

Análisis de Snippet 1: El documento 1, proveniente de la OCDE, subraya la importancia de desarrollar una visión estratégica a largo plazo que defina resultados deseados en materia de desarrollo sostenible y las acciones necesarias para alcanzar la coherencia entre sectores y niveles de gobierno. Se destaca la necesidad de alinear las políticas internas y externas en áreas que puedan afectar a los países en desarrollo.1 Este planteamiento se conecta directamente con la dimensión de "Legado", que se centra en el impacto duradero y los resultados que el gobierno busca construir a largo plazo. La OCDE enfatiza que esta visión debe considerar las implicaciones tanto a nivel nacional como internacional, lo que sugiere que el programa de Guanajuato debería tener en cuenta su contexto global y las posibles colaboraciones internacionales. Además, la coherencia entre los diferentes niveles de gobierno es esencial para asegurar que la visión a largo plazo se traduzca eficazmente en políticas y acciones concretas a nivel estatal.

## 5. Conclusión

El análisis de las fuentes internacionales recientes, enmarcadas bajo las dimensiones de la Arquitectura de Horizontes, revela tendencias y recomendaciones significativas para la formulación del Programa de Gobierno de Guanajuato 2024–2030. En la dimensión de Legado, la OCDE subraya la necesidad de una visión estratégica a largo plazo con objetivos de desarrollo sostenible y coherencia política. Respecto a la Comunidad, se destaca la importancia de la participación ciudadana inclusiva y el compromiso de las partes interesadas, con ejemplos prácticos y datos que resaltan la variación global en los niveles de participación. En cuanto al Aprendizaje, la OCDE identifica tendencias en innovación gubernamental que enfatizan la adaptación y la mejora continua. La dimensión de Tecnología se ve marcada por la relevancia de la transformación digital centrada en las personas, la necesidad de abordar la brecha digital y el surgimiento de marcos para la sostenibilidad digital. En el Contexto, se resalta la urgencia de la implementación de la Nueva Agenda Urbana y los ODS, así como la importancia de considerar las tendencias y desafíos sociales en América Latina según la CEPAL. Finalmente, en la dimensión de Proyectos, ONU-Hábitat recomienda la planificación estratégica con gobernanza participativa y alianzas interinstitucionales.

Estos hallazgos sugieren la necesidad de que el Programa de Gobierno de Guanajuato 2024–2030 incorpore una visión de largo plazo alineada con los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, fomente la participación activa e inclusiva de la ciudadanía y las partes interesadas, promueva la innovación y la adaptación en la gestión pública, avance en la transformación digital de manera sostenible e inclusiva, considere el contexto global y regional, y planifique y ejecute proyectos de manera estratégica y colaborativa.

En los últimos años, los países de la región han llevado a cabo importantes reformas del sector público para lograr gobiernos más agiles, más abiertos y más innovadores, con base en los cuatro principios: innovación digital, participación ciudadana, transparencia pública, y rendición de cuentas. Algunos países son pioneros en la transición del concepto de Gobierno Abierto hacia el de Estado Abierto, mediante la difusión de estos principios en todas las ramas del Estado y niveles de gobierno.

World Cities Report 2024: Cities and Climate Action | UN-Habitat

Cities are both the victims of climate change and among its worst offenders: though disproportionately exposed to its impacts, they are also responsible for generating a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. From flooding to heatwaves, powerful storms to drought, urban areas frequently find themselves on the frontline of the climate crisis. Many of the world’s largest mega-cities concentrate millions of people and trillions of dollars in assets into areas that are becoming more vulnerable to sudden shocks with every passing year. As they continue to expand, so too does their exposure, paving the way for potentially catastrophic disasters in future.

World Cities Report 2024: Cities and Climate Action | UN-Habitat

Climate change is in many ways exacerbating existing inequalities, as the urban poor and other marginalized groups and communities find themselves facing its most extreme impacts with least resources. The complex effects of climate change demand a comprehensive approach, encompassing not only immediate environmental symptoms but also the underlying social drivers of vulnerability. But while the overlapping challenges of environmental stress and rapid urbanization are uniquely daunting, it is precisely this intersection that makes urban climate action so opportune. Climate action can bring an array of additional benefits to cities and residents, from poverty reduction, employment, resilient

World Cities Report 2024: Cities and Climate Action | UN-Habitat

While projections show that without appropriate measures in place cities will suffer considerable impacts as a result of extreme weather events associated with climate change, these worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable. The decisions we make now, both in terms of mitigating the causes of climate change through decarbonization and strengthening adaptation by making cities more resilient, will determine to a large extent their severity. If national and local governments are willing to commit to a truly transformative approach, then climate action could serve as a vital tool in delivering a broader agenda of inclusion and social justice.

World Cities Report 2022: Envisaging the Future of Cities | UN-Habitat

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 created a temporary crisis of confidence in the future of cities. However, a broad consensus is that urbanization remains a powerful twenty-first century mega-trend; and that well- planned towns and cities remain central to the sustainable development trajectory. There is a sense of optimism that the crisis may provide us with the opportunity to build back differently, more inclusively, greener and safer.
