(We can have live illustration drawing what participants say)<br><br>- Co-leads present: challenges with the current global health system and some reactions (perhaps people vote virtually for the most significant challenge)<br><br>- Re-imagining a new global health architecture facilitated by Michael Reich:<br><br>- Why? For what purpose? (link it to the main challenges)<br><br>- What kind of global health architecture our countries need? What are they willing to give in return?<br><br>- What should a new global health architecture do? <br><br>- What should countries do? |
