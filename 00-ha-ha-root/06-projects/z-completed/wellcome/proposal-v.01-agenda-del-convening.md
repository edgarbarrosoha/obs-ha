### **Agenda: A Regional Dialogue on Global Health Architecture Reform**

**A Latin American and Caribbean Perspective**

**Convening Approach:** This dialogue is a structured forum for senior stakeholders to provide strategic direction on the reform of the global health architecture. The process is designed to build upon an extensive pre-convening consultation phase. The role of participants is to validate findings, shape strategic priorities, and build consensus. The facilitation team will be responsible for capturing discussions and synthesising them into the final outputs.

### **Day 1: Analysis of the Current Architecture and Formulation of Strategic Shifts**

**Objective:** To establish a common diagnosis of the global health architecture's performance from a regional perspective and to formulate a set of high-level Strategic Shifts required for its reform.

### **08:30 – 09:00 | Arrival and Coffee**

- An informal networking period for participants.
    

### **09:00 – 10:00 | Opening Session: Framework and Objectives (Plenary)**

- **(10 mins) Welcome:** Remarks by the Regional Chair on the purpose and strategic importance of the convening.
    
- **(20 mins) The Global Context for Reform:** Michael will establish the strategic context for the dialogue. He will provide a critical analysis of how the current global health architecture evolved, characterising it not as a cohesively designed system but as a fragmented 'patchwork' of actors and initiatives. The presentation will examine the significant shifts in the geopolitical and financial landscape—including evolving donor narratives and new funding constraints—that challenge the viability of the current model. This analysis will frame the central task of the convening: to move beyond diagnosis and define the necessary functions and principles for a more effective and equitable global health architecture.
    
- **(20 mins) The Regional Perspective and Process Overview:** The Project Lead (Abril Campos) will present a high-level synthesis of the key reform areas identified during the consultation phase. She will then outline the convening's objectives, methodology, and intended final outputs.
    
- **(15 mins) Plenary Q&A:** Participants are invited to ask clarifying questions regarding the context, process, and objectives of the meeting.
    

### **10:00 – 11:30 | Session 1: Consensus on Strategic Reforms and Prioritisation (Interactive Plenary)**

- **Objective:** To facilitate a frank and inclusive deliberation to test, challenge, and refine the proposed strategic reforms, thereby surfacing an emerging regional consensus on priorities that will guide subsequent work towards concrete proposals.
    
- **Format:** This 90-minute session is designed as a dynamic, four-part sequence to ensure a clear directionality, moving from an evidence-based starting point to an action-oriented mandate.
    
    - **(20 mins) Part 1: Presentation of the Synthesized Strategic Reforms**
        
        - The Project Lead and key colleagues present the 4-5 core strategic reforms that emerged from the evidence-based consultation phase.
            
        - Each reform will be presented as an initial proposal, intended to stimulate and provoke wider dialogue.
            
    - **(30 mins) Part 2: Open and Honest Dialogue for Refinement**
        
        - Following the presentation, the facilitator opens a plenary dialogue designed to test, challenge, and refine the proposals. This is a critical opportunity for participants to engage in an interactive and honest dialogue, respectfully critique different views, and ensure a breadth of voices is heard.
            
        - The discussion will clarify the language and substance of the reforms, aiming they accurately reflect the group's collective thinking before the prioritisation exercise. A live rapporteur will capture refinements.
            
    - **(10 mins) Part 3: Anonymous Digital Prioritisation**
        
        - To enable an honest and uninfluenced expression of priorities, the facilitator will conduct an anonymous digital vote using a simple polling tool.
            
        - Participants will be asked to rank the refined reforms. This method ensures that the emerging consensus is built on the candid perspectives of all stakeholders.
            
    - **(30 mins) Part 4: Revealing and Interpreting the Regional Consensus about the Global Architecture Reform**
        
        - The facilitator reveals the aggregated results, presenting a clear, rank-ordered list that represents the emerging regional consensus on reform priorities.
            
        - This data becomes the catalyst for a final, forward-looking strategic discussion, guided by questions aimed at interpreting the results:
            
            - _"What does this clear prioritisation signal about our region's collective vision for a new global health architecture?"_
                
            - _"How does this consensus provide us with the clear directionality needed to develop actionable reform pathways?"_
                
        - The session concludes with the facilitator confirming that this prioritised list forms the action-orientated mandate for the focused working groups in Session 2.

### **11:45 – 13:00 | Session 2: Developing Implementation Pathways for Priority Reforms (Working Groups)**

- **Objective:** To generate concrete, actionable ideas on the implementation pathways for the highest-priority reforms identified in Session 1.
    
- **Format:** This session is conducted in working groups to facilitate in-depth discussion and detailed brainstorming.
    
    - **(15 mins) Briefing and Group Formation (Plenary):**
        
        - The facilitator assigns participants to pre-arranged working groups. Each group is tasked with focusing on 2-3 of the top-priority reforms.
            
        - The objective is clearly stated: to move from "what" to "how" by outlining the critical steps for implementation.
            
    - **(60 mins) Group Work on "The How":**
        
        - Each group uses a structured template to guide their discussion for their assigned reforms. The template will prompt them to identify:
            
            1. **Catalytic Actions:** What are the 1-2 most critical first steps or policy changes needed?
                
            2. **Key Actors & Roles:** Which specific global, regional, and national institutions must lead, support, or be influenced?
                
            3. **Enabling Conditions & Barriers:** What are the primary political, financial, or structural enablers to leverage and barriers to overcome?
                
    - **(15 mins) Synthesis and Preparation for Report-Back:**
        
        - Groups synthesize their key findings on the template, preparing a concise summary for the afternoon's plenary session.

### **14:30 – 15:45 | Session 3: Integrating Reform Pathways and Identifying Collaboration Paths (Plenary)**

- **Objective:** To collectively review the implementation pathways developed in the working groups, identify cross-cutting themes, and build a more holistic, integrated view of the reform agenda.
    
- **Format:** This session is designed to move from individual group reports to a collective strategic synthesis.
    
    - **(45 mins) Part 1: Report-Back from Working Groups**
        
        - A rapporteur from each working group provides a concise (5 minute) presentation of their key findings on the "how," focusing on the catalytic actions, key actors, and primary barriers identified for their assigned priority reforms.
            
        - A brief period for clarifying questions follows each presentation to ensure shared understanding.
            
    - **(45 mins) Part 2: Facilitated Synthesis Dialogue**
        
        - After all groups have reported, the facilitator guides a plenary discussion to connect the dots and identify overarching patterns. The discussion will be structured around key questions:
            
            1. **Synergies:** _"What are the common catalytic actions or key actors that appear across multiple reform priorities?"_
                
            2. **Tensions:** _"Where do we see potential tensions or contradictions in the implementation pathways that need to be addressed?"_
                
            3. **Governance Implications:** _"What do these pathways collectively tell us about the fundamental changes needed in global health governance and decision-making structures?"_
                
        - A rapporteur will visually map these cross-cutting themes to create an integrated view of the reform effort.

### **16:00 – 17:30 | Session 4: Deep Dive on Financing the New Architecture (Structured Idea Generation Workshop)**

- **Objective:** To capture concrete proposals and key principles from all participants on how international health financing should be mobilised, prioritised, and delivered, creating a rich, co-created input for the final consensus paper.
    
- **Format:** This session uses a "Gallery Walk" methodology to move from expert framing to parallel brainstorming in small groups, and concluding with a collective synthesis in plenary.
    
    - **(15 mins) Part 1: Framing the Challenge (Plenary)**
        
        - The appointed expert provides a brief, provocative framing of the core challenges and questions in global health financing, linking them directly to the reforms discussed earlier. This sets a common intellectual foundation for all participants.
            
    - **(45 mins) Part 2: Interactive Idea Generation in Groups (Gallery Walk)**
        
        - **Setup:** Around the room, four flip-chart "stations" are set up, each with a key question derived from the contract and pre-populated with 1-2 seed ideas from the consultation phase.
            
            - **Station 1: Mobilisation:** _What innovative mechanisms can mobilise new resources for health?_
                
            - **Station 2: Prioritisation & Eligibility:** _How must we reform eligibility and prioritisation criteria (beyond GDP) to be more equitable?_
                
            - **Station 3: Delivery Models:** _What changes to delivery (e.g., country systems, pooled funds) would have the most impact?_
                
            - **Station 4: Equity & Accountability:** _What accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure financing reaches the most vulnerable?_
                
        - **Process:** Participants are divided into 4-5 small groups. Each group starts at a different station. For 10 minutes, they discuss the question and write their concrete proposals and ideas on the flip chart. After 10 minutes, the facilitator signals the groups to rotate to the next station.
            
        - **Outcome:** After four rotations, every participant has contributed ideas to every key question, and the flip charts are covered in a rich dataset of collective proposals.
            
    - **(30 mins) Part 3: Collective Synthesis and Harvesting Key Principles (Plenary)**
        
        - **"Reading the Room":** Participants are given 5 minutes for a "silent gallery walk" to read the ideas on all the posters.
            
        - **Facilitated Synthesis:** The facilitator then guides a final plenary discussion, not to generate new ideas, but to synthesize what is on the walls. The questions will be:
            
            1. _"Looking at these proposals, what are the 2-3 most powerful and recurring principles that emerge for financing reform?"_
                
            2. _"Which specific proposal on these charts represents the most actionable or 'game-changing' idea we should champion?"_
                
        - A lead rapporteur captures these synthesised principles and top proposals, which now represent the validated consensus of the entire group. This directly creates the substance for the financing section of the final report.

### **16:30 – 17:00 | Closing Session for Day 1: Synthesis, Reflections, and Outlook**

- **Objective:** To consolidate the day's progress, allow for participant reflection, and set a clear direction for Day 2.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(15 mins) Synthesis of the Day:** The Project Lead or a lead rapporteur will present a concise, high-level summary of the day's key outcomes: the prioritised list of reforms, the initial implementation pathways, the cross-cutting governance themes, and the emerging principles on financing.
        
    - **(10 mins) Participant Reflections:** The facilitator will invite a few participants to share a brief reflection on the day's dialogue or a key insight they have gained.
        
    - **(5 mins) Outlook for Day 2 and Closing Remarks:** The Regional Chair will briefly frame the agenda for Day 2, which will focus on building consensus on a final set of proposals and defining a clear Call to Action. The Chair will then offer closing remarks for the day.

    - **(15 mins) Framing the Day:** The Chair outlines the day's ambitious goal: to define the _function and form_ of this new architecture and articulate the institutional commitments necessary to achieve it.
        

Of course. This is an excellent directive. We will merge the power of the "Future State" visioning exercise with the structured, systemic logic of the HA Framework.

Instead of asking groups to fill out the entire HA matrix as a project plan, we will use the "Future State" scenario to help them populate the final **"Legado" (Legacy)** column of the HA matrix. This transforms the matrix from a daunting task into a creative tool. By defining the end state first, the subsequent work on pathways becomes more intuitive and strategic.

Here is the revised Session 5, meticulously designed to achieve this synthesis.

---

### **09:30 – 11:00 | Session 5: Visioning the Future State and Defining the Legacy (HA Framework Workshop)**

- **Objective:** To translate the priority reforms into a tangible, high-level vision of a "Future State" architecture and to use that vision to define the "Legado" (Legacy) across the key dimensions of the HA framework.
    
- **Methodology:** **HA Legacy Definition via Future State Analysis.** This method uses a powerful narrative scenario to immerse participants in a future where the reforms have succeeded. Their analysis of this "Future State" is then used to populate the final "Legacy" column of the HA matrix, creating a clear, multi-dimensional definition of long-term success that will anchor the subsequent pathway-building work.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(20 mins) Part 1: Framing the Future State and Introducing the HA Legacy Framework (Plenary)**
        
        - The facilitator introduces the session's objective: _"We have our priority reforms. Now, we will leap forward in time to imagine what success looks like in practice. This vision of the 'Future State' will become our North Star—our 'Legado'—for the rest of our strategic work."_
            
        - **Future State Scenario:** The facilitator presents a vivid scenario: _"It is 2035. A novel respiratory virus with high transmissibility is detected in two LAC countries. How does the reformed global health architecture, shaped by our priorities, now respond?"_
            
        - **Introducing the HA Legacy Matrix:** The facilitator projects a simplified matrix containing only the **Dimensions** and the final **"Legado"** column. The task is explained: _"We will not be building a plan. We will be describing this successful future state through the lens of these six key dimensions."_
            
    - **(50 mins) Part 2: Defining the Legacy in Working Groups**
        
        - Participants, in their pre-assigned working groups, receive a large-format poster showing the HA Dimensions and the "Legado" column.
            
        - Their task is to discuss the "Future State" scenario and, for each of the six dimensions, write a concise, powerful statement describing what that future looks like. The facilitator will provide prompts:
            
            - **Legacy:** What is the ultimate consolidated outcome?
                
            - **Community:** Who is now at the table and how have alliances evolved?
                
            - **Learning:** How is knowledge now captured and shared systemically?
                
            - **Technology:** What platforms and tools are now sustainably embedded in the system?
                
            - **Context:** How has the architecture anchored itself to be resilient against future trends?
                
            - **Projects:** What is the sustainable, long-term outcome of our initial actions?
                
    - **(20 mins) Part 3: Plenary Harvest of the "Legado" Vision**
        
        - One rapporteur from each group shares 2-3 of the most powerful "Legado" statements their group generated.
            
        - This rapid sharing session is not for debate but for inspiration and alignment, allowing the facilitation team to synthesize a rich, multi-faceted, and collectively-owned vision of long-term success. The detailed posters are collected as invaluable raw data for the final report.
            
- **Deliverable (Internal):**
    
    - **A Multi-Dimensional Definition of the "Legado":** A synthesized description of the desired future state, structured by the six dimensions of the HA framework. This becomes the clear and ambitious endpoint for the implementation pathways to be discussed later in the dialogue.

### **11:00 – 11:15 | Coffee Break**

---

### **11:30 – 13:00 | Session 6: Identifying Near-Term Catalytic Actions (Structured Convergence Workshop)**

- **Objective:** To identify and prioritize a concise set of the most critical, cross-cutting "Near-Term Priorities" (18-24 months) required to build momentum across the entire reform agenda.
    
- **Why this is necessary:** The Lusaka Agenda's power lies in its ability to connect long-term vision with concrete, immediate actions. This session is designed to generate that exact content. By asking senior leaders to identify the highest-leverage, cross-cutting actions (e.g., "harmonize metrics," "align funding cycles," "establish a regional procurement mechanism"), we capture their unique strategic perspective and create the substance for the most actionable chapter of the final consensus paper. This moves beyond individual pathways to define the core enablers for the entire system's evolution.
    
- **Methodology:** **Structured Convergence Workshop (1-2-4-All).** This is a highly efficient, inclusive, and structured process that allows for individual reflection, small-group refinement, and plenary synthesis. It ensures that the best ideas from all 45 participants are surfaced, clustered, and prioritized in a short amount of time, without becoming an unmanageable open discussion.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(10 mins) Part 1: Framing the Task (Plenary)**
        
        - The facilitator sets the stage: _"We have defined our priority reforms and their pathways. Now, we must answer a critical question: What are the 3-5 most catalytic, cross-cutting actions we must take in the next 18-24 months to unlock progress across all of them?"_
            
        - The facilitator shows examples of "Near-Term Priorities" from the Lusaka Agenda (e.g., Common Metrics, Aligning with Government Systems) to frame the type of strategic, cross-cutting thinking required.
            
    - **(10 mins) Part 2: Individual Brainstorming (Silent Reflection)**
        
        - Each participant individually writes down 1-2 ideas for the most critical "Near-Term Priorities" on sticky notes. This ensures that initial ideas are generated without groupthink.
            
    - **(20 mins) Part 3: Paired Discussion and Idea Refinement**
        
        - Participants turn to a partner to share their individual ideas. In pairs, they discuss, clarify, and identify the single most powerful idea between them. This begins the process of synthesis.
            
    - **(30 mins) Part 4: Small Group Synthesis and Prioritization**
        
        - Pairs join to form small groups of 4-6. The task for each group is to review all the ideas from their members, cluster them by theme, and agree on the **Top 3 "Near-Term Priorities"** that would have the greatest systemic impact. These are written clearly on a flip chart.
            
    - **(20 mins) Part 5: Plenary Harvest and Final Consensus**
        
        - A rapporteur from each group presents only their **#1 Top Priority**.
            
        - The facilitator captures these on a central board, clustering similar ideas as they are presented.
            
        - This rapid report-out builds a powerful visual representation of the group's consensus. The facilitator then guides a brief final discussion to confirm and refine the wording of the final 3-5 "Near-Term Priorities" for the region.
            
- **Deliverable (Internal):**
    
    - **A Prioritized List of 3-5 "Near-Term Catalytic Actions."** This output provides the complete, high-quality substance needed for a critical, action-oriented section of the final consensus document, directly mirroring the structure of the Lusaka Agenda.

### **13:00 – 14:15 | Lunch**

### **The "Commitment Formulation Workshop"**

---

### **14:15 – 16:00 | Session 7: Formulating the "Call to Action" – A Commitment Workshop (Plenary & Working Groups)**

- **Objective:** To draft and build consensus around a concise set of specific, high-level commitments and "asks" for key stakeholder sectors, which will form the substance of the "Call to Action."
    
- **Why this is necessary:** To create a document with the authority of the Lusaka Agenda, we must move beyond brainstorming to the deliberate formulation of powerful statements. This session is designed to leverage the collective expertise of the participants to draft the core text of the "Call to Action" in real-time, ensuring the final output is not just a summary of ideas, but a declaration of collective intent.
    
- **Methodology:** **Parallel Drafting & Plenary Synthesis.** This method uses static working groups to develop parallel drafts of the commitments, which are then brought to the plenary for a rapid synthesis and refinement process. This is a highly effective way to build robust, consensus-driven text.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(15 mins) Part 1: Framing the Task and Deconstructing the "Call to Action" (Plenary)**
        
        - The facilitator sets the stage: _"We have our vision and our pathways. Now, we will formulate our unified 'Call to Action.' Our task is not to generate more ideas, but to draft the specific, powerful statements we will direct to the key actors in the global health ecosystem."_
            
        - The facilitator projects the "Call to Action" section from the Lusaka Agenda, highlighting its structure: **[Actor] should [Action] to achieve [Goal].** This provides a clear model for the required output.
            
    - **(60 mins) Part 2: Drafting the Commitments (Working Groups)**
        
        - Participants return to their established working groups. **Crucially, each group is tasked with drafting commitments for ALL key stakeholder sectors.** This parallel process is vital for identifying natural areas of consensus.
            
        - Each group receives a structured template for the three key sectors:
            
            1. **Global Institutions & Funders:** Draft 1-2 key "asks" directed at the Boards of GHIs, MDBs, and WHO leadership.
                
            2. **LAC Governments & Regional Bodies:** Draft 1-2 key commitments that governments and regional institutions (PAHO, IDB) must undertake.
                
            3. **Civil Society, Academia & Private Sector:** Draft 1 key statement on the essential role and commitment of these non-state actors.
                
        - The focus is on crafting clear, concise, and powerful language suitable for the final document.
            
    - **(30 mins) Part 3: Plenary Synthesis and Refinement**
        
        - The facilitator guides a highly structured synthesis process, focusing on one stakeholder sector at a time.
            
        - **For "Global Institutions & Funders":** The facilitator asks a rapporteur from each group to read aloud only their top-drafted "ask." A live rapporteur types these parallel statements on the main screen.
            
        - The facilitator then guides the plenary to synthesize these 4-5 similar statements into a single, powerful consensus "ask."
            
        - This process is repeated for "LAC Governments & Regional Bodies" and "Non-State Actors."
            
        - The outcome is not a report-back, but a live, co-creation of the final, consensus-driven text for the "Call to Action."
            
- **Deliverable (Internal):**
    
    - **A Draft Set of 3-5 Consensus "Call to Action" Statements.** This output is the near-final text for the most politically important section of the consensus paper, crafted and validated by the participants themselves.

### **16:00 – 16:15 | Coffee Break**

---

### **16:15 – 17:15 | Session 8: Synthesizing the Reimagined Architecture (System Mapping Workshop)**

- **Objective:** To synthesize the core components of the "LAC Consensus" (priority shifts, pathways, financing principles) into a single, coherent visual model of a reimagined Global Health Architecture, and to use this model to refine the final narrative for the global stage.
    
- **Why this is necessary:** A list of reforms is powerful, but a visual diagram that shows how they fit together to create a new, functional system is far more compelling and easier to communicate globally. This session provides the ultimate "coherence check" by forcing participants to connect the dots between all the elements they've developed. The resulting visual becomes the intellectual and communicative centerpiece of the final document—the tangible representation of the "reimagined architecture."
    
- **Methodology:** **Live System Mapping.** This is a highly interactive, facilitator-led plenary workshop where the group co-creates a diagram in real-time. It moves from individual components to a holistic, systemic view, revealing the core logic, feedback loops, and power shifts of the proposed new architecture.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(10 mins) Part 1: Framing the Task – From a List to a System (Plenary)**
        
        - The facilitator sets the stage: _"Over the past two days, we have built the essential components of our regional vision. In this final working session, we will bring them all together. Our task is to move from a list of reforms to a visual map of the new architecture itself. What does this new system actually look like?"_
            
    - **(40 mins) Part 2: Live Co-Creation of the Architecture Diagram**
        
        - A large, central whiteboard or digital screen is used by a graphic facilitator or lead rapporteur.
            
        - The facilitator starts by placing a few core, agreed-upon "nodes" at the center of the diagram (e.g., "LAC Countries & Regional Bodies," "Reformed Global Institutions").
            
        - The facilitator then guides a structured, generative discussion, using the outputs from the previous sessions to build out the map:
            
            - **Adding Components:** _"Based on our priority shifts, what new functions or entities must exist? A 'Regional Platform for Health Technologies'? A 'Fair Financing Mechanism'?"_ (New nodes are added).
                
            - **Drawing Connections:** _"How do these connect? What is the flow of information, funding, and accountability between them?"_ (Arrows are drawn).
                
            - **Defining Relationships:** _"Looking at our 'Call to Action,' what words define these new relationships? 'Co-investment,' 'Shared Governance,' 'Transparent Reporting'?"_ (Labels are added to the arrows).
                
        - This live, visual co-creation process forces a final, high-level discussion on how the pieces interact, revealing the system's core logic.
            
    - **(10 mins) Part 3: Articulating the Core Narrative**
        
        - With the completed diagram in view, the facilitator asks the group one final, crystallizing question: _"Looking at this picture, what is the single most powerful, one-sentence story this diagram tells the world about our vision for a reformed Global Health Architecture?"_
            
        - This final step harvests the overarching narrative and provides the key message for the Executive Summary of the final document.
            
- **Deliverable (Internal):**
    
    - **A Draft Visual Model of the Reimagined Global Health Architecture.** This single, co-created diagram becomes the powerful, synthesizing visual at the heart of the final consensus paper, representing the holistic vision of the region.

### **17:15 – 18:00 | Closing Session: Governance, Next Steps, and Formal Conclusion**

- **Objective:** To agree on a post-convening governance mechanism, confirm immediate next steps, and formally close the dialogue.
    
- **Format:**
    
    - **(15 mins) The Path Forward:** The Project Lead outlines the immediate next steps: a clear 30-60-90 day plan for drafting the consensus paper, a rapid review process involving a representative group of participants, and the strategy for disseminating the final document. A proposal for a light-touch governance mechanism for follow-up is presented.
        
    - **(15 mins) Final Reflections:** The facilitator invites final brief reflections from participants on the process and outcomes.
        
    - **(15 mins) Formal Close:** The Regional Chair delivers comprehensive closing remarks, acknowledging the significance of the consensus achieved and formally concluding the dialogue.
