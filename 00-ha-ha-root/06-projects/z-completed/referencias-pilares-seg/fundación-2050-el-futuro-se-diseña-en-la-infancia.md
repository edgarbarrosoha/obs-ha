### 1. Impact of early childhood education

**Research question:**
How does the quality of early childhood education programs influence students' long-term cognitive, emotional, and social development, and what are the most effective approaches to foster resilience and curiosity at this stage?

The quality of early childhood education (ECE) programs significantly influences students' long-term cognitive, emotional, and social development. High-quality ECE programs are associated with improved cognitive skills, emotional well-being, and social competence, which are crucial for lifelong success. Effective approaches to fostering resilience and curiosity in early childhood include creating supportive learning environments, emphasizing caregiver sensitivity, and integrating physical education. Below, we explore these aspects in detail.

## Cognitive Development

- High-quality ECE programs are linked to enhanced cognitive development, particularly in STEM fields. For instance, caregiving quality in ECE settings, characterized by sensitivity and cognitive stimulation, has been shown to reduce disparities in STEM achievement among children from low-income backgrounds(Bustamante et al., 2023).
- Emotional quality in early education programs, such as providing emotional support, is associated with improved language development, highlighting the importance of nurturing environments for cognitive growth(Rankin et al., 2022).
- In rural China, attending kindergarten is associated with significant improvements in cognitive skills, as evidenced by higher standardized test scores and reduced grade retention(Tang et al., 2023).

## Emotional and Social Development

- The quality of preschool learning environments plays a protective role in children's social-emotional development, particularly during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality interactions in childcare can prevent the development of social problems among children(Oppermann et al., 2024).
- Programs like the "Hello Sunshine" ball game-based curriculum have been effective in promoting self-regulation and fundamental movement skills, which are crucial for emotional and social development(Wu et al., 2024).
- The EASEL Approach, a set of educator practices, aims to improve social, emotional, behavioral, and executive functioning outcomes in children, demonstrating the importance of structured interventions in enhancing social-emotional skills(Tan et al., 2023).

## Fostering Resilience and Curiosity

- Child-centered approaches and teacher qualifications are critical quality indicators in ECE, fostering an environment that encourages curiosity and resilience(Sağlam et al., 2023).
- Physical education programs that incorporate structured activities, such as ball games, have been shown to significantly enhance self-regulation and movement skills, contributing to resilience and curiosity(Wu et al., 2024).
- The "Accompagne-moi...!" intervention in France highlights the importance of professional training and awareness of children's emotions in fostering resilience, although challenges in implementation can affect outcomes(Joakim et al., 2023).

## Broader Perspectives

While high-quality ECE programs are beneficial, the effectiveness of these programs can vary based on contextual factors such as cultural values, the centralization of the education system, and stakeholder expectations(Sağlam et al., 2023). Additionally, the well-being of children in ECE settings is interdependent with the well-being of educators, emphasizing the need for supportive working conditions for educators to effectively foster resilience and curiosity in children(Joakim et al., 2023). Furthermore, the significance of quality measures may vary across different settings, suggesting the need for adaptable and contextually relevant approaches to ECE quality assessment(Raikes et al., 2023).

### 2. Socioemotional skills and their relationship to future success

**Research question:**
How do socioemotional skills acquired in childhood and adolescence contribute to academic and professional success in adulthood, and what pedagogical approaches are most effective for their development in primary and secondary education?

Socioemotional skills acquired during childhood and adolescence play a crucial role in shaping academic and professional success in adulthood. These skills, which include emotional intelligence, empathy, self-regulation, and social awareness, are foundational for effective interpersonal relationships and personal well-being. The development of these skills can be significantly influenced by pedagogical approaches in primary and secondary education. This response explores the contribution of socioemotional skills to success and identifies effective pedagogical strategies for their development.

## Contribution of Socioemotional Skills to Success

- **Academic Performance**: Socioemotional skills are linked to improved academic outcomes. Programs that focus on emotional intelligence and social skills have been shown to enhance students' understanding and regulation of emotions, leading to better academic performance(Andrade & Carvalho, 2024) (Martins, 2024). For instance, socioemotional learning (SEL) programs can increase academic knowledge by 11% and reduce antisocial behavior by 10%(Hasanova & Kravchenko, 2023).
    
- **Professional Success**: In the professional realm, socioemotional skills such as self-confidence, resilience, and empathy are critical for career advancement. These skills help individuals navigate complex social environments, make ethical decisions, and maintain effective relationships(Pereira, 2023) (Butvilas & Kovaitė, 2022). The ability to manage emotions and understand others' perspectives is essential for leadership and teamwork(Shvets et al., 2024).
    
- **Life Outcomes**: Beyond academics and career, socioemotional skills contribute to overall life satisfaction and well-being. They are associated with positive life outcomes, including better mental health and social relationships(Santibáñez & Solabarrieta, 2023) (Butvilas & Kovaitė, 2022). These skills enable individuals to cope with challenges and adapt to changing circumstances, which are vital for long-term success("Social and emotional skills (SES)", 2023).
    

## Effective Pedagogical Approaches

- **Socioemotional Learning Programs**: Implementing SEL programs in schools is a proven method for developing socioemotional skills. These programs focus on emotion recognition, conflict resolution, and empathetic behavior, which are crucial for students' social competence and academic success(Andrade & Carvalho, 2024) (Hasanova & Kravchenko, 2023).
    
- **Cooperative Learning and Project-Based Methods**: Engaging students in cooperative activities and group projects fosters social skills and teamwork. These methods encourage students to work collaboratively, enhancing their communicative potential and critical thinking abilities(Shvets et al., 2024). Such approaches are effective in secondary education, where students are at a pivotal stage for developing these competencies(Shvets et al., 2024).
    
- **Teacher Training and Curriculum Integration**: Educators play a vital role in nurturing socioemotional skills. Training teachers to incorporate socioemotional education into their curricula can address deficiencies in students' emotional awareness and interpersonal skills(Orellana & Vásquez, 2024). Integrating socioemotional education into teacher training programs is essential for creating a balanced and healthy learning environment(Calderón, 2024).
    
- **Assessment and Feedback**: Utilizing comprehensive assessment tools to measure socioemotional skills can guide educators in tailoring their teaching strategies. Multi-method and multi-informant assessments provide a holistic view of students' socioemotional competencies, allowing for targeted interventions(Santibáñez & Solabarrieta, 2023).
    

While the importance of socioemotional skills is widely recognized, challenges remain in their integration into educational systems. Traditional educational models often prioritize intellectual capacities over emotional training, which can hinder the comprehensive development of students(Calderón, 2024). Additionally, the availability and implementation of SEL programs vary across regions, highlighting the need for broader adoption and support from educational policymakers(Andrade & Carvalho, 2024). Addressing these challenges is crucial for maximizing the benefits of socioemotional education in fostering academic and professional success.

### 3. Adaptability and preparation for the 21st century

**Research question:**
How can an educational curriculum be designed that prepares students from childhood to face the challenges of the 21st century, such as automation and artificial intelligence, and what role do adaptability and problem-solving skills play in this process?

Designing an educational curriculum that equips students from childhood to face the challenges of the 21st century, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI), requires a multifaceted approach. This involves integrating AI literacy, fostering adaptability, and enhancing problem-solving skills. The curriculum should be dynamic, incorporating both theoretical knowledge and practical experiences to prepare students for a rapidly evolving world. Below, we explore key components of such a curriculum and the roles of adaptability and problem-solving skills.

## Early AI Education and Literacy

- Introducing AI concepts early in education can significantly enhance children's computational thinking, sequencing, and self-regulation skills. Studies show that both cooperative play and direct instruction in AI education can improve these skills, with each method having unique strengths. For instance, direct instruction is more effective in enhancing computational thinking, while cooperative play better develops theory of mind skills(Su et al., 2024).
- AI literacy programs, such as the AI4KG curriculum, have been shown to increase young children's understanding of AI and improve their attitudes towards technology. However, these programs need further development to assess their long-term impact on children's education and career paths(Su & Yang, 2023).

### 4. Inclusive and equitable education

**Research question:**
What educational strategies can ensure equitable and accessible investment from early childhood to secondary education, and how does inequality in the quality of early education affect the cognitive and emotional development of students in vulnerable communities?

Ensuring equitable and accessible investment in education from early childhood to secondary education is crucial for fostering cognitive and emotional development, particularly in vulnerable communities. Inequality in early education quality can significantly impact children's developmental outcomes, necessitating strategic educational interventions. This response explores educational strategies to promote equity and accessibility and examines the effects of inequality in early education on student development.

## Educational Strategies for Equity and Accessibility

- **AI-Powered Educational Decision Support Systems (EDSS):** AI technologies can enhance educational equity by providing personalized learning experiences and insights. However, they must be designed with a socio-technical and cultural perspective to avoid reinforcing existing inequalities. This involves addressing biases in AI systems and ensuring that the needs of marginalized groups are prioritized(Viberg et al., 2024).
    
- **Nutrition Investment in Early Childhood Education:** Adequate nutrition is vital for cognitive development. Targeted nutrition support in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings can address developmental vulnerabilities, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Geographic mapping of nutritional needs can guide resource allocation to ensure that children in socio-economically disadvantaged areas receive the necessary support(Elliott et al., 2023).
    
- **Participatory Pedagogy:** Implementing participatory educational teams can promote equity and social justice, especially for children from ethnic minorities and low-income families. This approach involves engaging communities in the educational process, fostering a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment(Formosinho & Figueiredo, 2014).
    
- **Interactive Groups in ECEC:** Organizing classrooms into small, mixed-ability groups with community volunteers can enhance cognitive, social, and emotional development. This inclusive classroom organization has been shown to benefit children from minority backgrounds by providing high-quality ECEC(Aubert et al., 2017).
    

## Impact of Inequality in Early Education

- **Concentrated Poverty and Cognitive Skills:** Economic stratification in preschool settings can lead to lower language and reading skills due to exposure to less cognitively skilled peers. This highlights the importance of addressing economic disparities in early education to improve cognitive outcomes(Coley et al., 2019).
    
- **Early Childhood Education Programs:** Programs like Centros de Desarrollo Infantil (CDI) in Ecuador demonstrate that increased exposure to quality early education can significantly enhance cognitive and socio-emotional development. However, these programs must be accessible to vulnerable families to reduce inequality gaps(Alvarado-Suárez & Acosta-González, 2022).
    
- **Risk and Protective Factors:** Inequality in early childhood is linked to various risk factors, including inadequate cognitive stimulation and nutritional deficiencies. Protective factors such as maternal education and breastfeeding can mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive early childhood development programs(Walker et al., 2011).
    

## Broader Perspectives

While targeted educational strategies and interventions are essential, broader systemic changes are also necessary to address the root causes of inequality. This includes improving social protection systems and investing in cognitive capital to support sustainable development and reduce economic disparities(Samson et al., 2016). Additionally, ensuring equitable access to high-quality early care and education for all children, including those from Hispanic and other minority backgrounds, remains a critical challenge that requires ongoing attention and investment(Smith et al., 2021).

In conclusion, a multifaceted approach that combines targeted educational strategies with systemic reforms is essential to ensure equitable and accessible education for all children, particularly those in vulnerable communities. Addressing inequality in early education can significantly enhance cognitive and emotional development, laying the foundation for lifelong learning and success.

### 6. Resilience and change

**Research question:**
What educational factors from early childhood influence students' resilience development, allowing them to adapt to future social and technological changes, and how can their adaptive capacity be measured throughout their educational trajectory?

The development of resilience in early childhood is crucial for enabling students to adapt to future social and technological changes. Various educational factors contribute to this resilience, and understanding these factors can help in designing interventions to enhance adaptive capacities. This response explores the cognitive, social, and environmental influences on resilience development and discusses methods to measure adaptive capacity throughout a student's educational journey.

## Cognitive and Executive Functioning

- Executive functions (EF), including inhibition, updating, and shifting, are foundational cognitive skills that significantly influence resilience development. These functions help children manage stress and adapt to changing environments. Inhibition is linked to both immediate and long-term resilience, while updating and shifting are associated with long-term resilience resources and functioning, respectively(Zhou et al., 2024).
- Cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving and critical thinking, are also crucial. High cognitive abilities are associated with resilient trajectories, suggesting that fostering these skills in early education can enhance resilience(Cahill et al., 2023).

## Social and Emotional Factors

- Positive relationships with adults, including parents and teachers, are vital for resilience. Supportive adult relationships during childhood are associated with lower stress and better mental health outcomes in young adulthood(VanBronkhorst et al., 2023).
- Emotional temperament and self-esteem are individual factors that contribute to resilience. Children with less emotional temperament and higher self-esteem are more likely to maintain resilience in the face of adversity(Cahill et al., 2023).
- Social support networks, including family, friends, and significant others, play a mediating role in resilience and academic success. These networks provide emotional and practical support, enhancing students' ability to cope with challenges(Lin et al., 2024).

## Environmental and Educational Influences

- Positive school experiences and extracurricular engagement are significant contributors to resilience. Schools that provide a supportive and engaging environment help students develop resilience by fostering a sense of belonging and competence(Cahill et al., 2023).
- Digital literacy and human-computer interaction are emerging factors in resilience development. Digital literacy enhances school readiness and mental well-being, with psychological resilience mediating these effects(Meng et al., 2023).
- Early childhood teachers' resilience and preparedness also impact children's resilience. Teachers with high self-efficacy and resilience can better support children's development, particularly in disaster preparedness contexts(Lee et al., 2023).

## Measuring Adaptive Capacity

- Resilience can be measured through various methods, including self-reported scales and observational assessments. Longitudinal studies tracking resilience resources and functioning over time provide insights into resilience trajectories(Zhou et al., 2024).
- Growth mixture modeling can identify distinct resilience trajectories within populations, helping to tailor interventions to specific needs(Cahill et al., 2023).
- Structural equation modeling and path analysis are useful for understanding the mediating roles of social support and other factors in resilience development(Lin et al., 2024).

While these factors highlight the importance of cognitive, social, and environmental influences on resilience, it is essential to consider the variability in resilience across different contexts. Sociocultural factors, such as family religiosity, may have unexpected effects on resilience, indicating the need for culturally sensitive approaches to resilience-building interventions(VanBronkhorst et al., 2023). Additionally, the role of coping strategies in resilience processes suggests that interventions should also focus on enhancing coping skills to support resilience development(Yang, 2023).

### 7. Preparing for future life

**Research question:**
What key competencies should be acquired in primary and secondary education to meet the personal and professional challenges of the future, and how can schools integrate values, interpersonal skills, and critical thinking into their curricular programs?

To prepare students for the personal and professional challenges of the future, primary and secondary education must focus on developing key competencies such as adaptability, critical thinking, creativity, and sustainability awareness. Schools can integrate these competencies by embedding values, interpersonal skills, and critical thinking into their curricular programs. This approach requires a shift from traditional educational models to more dynamic, student-centered learning experiences.

## Key Competencies for Future Challenges

- **Adaptability and Lifelong Learning**: In the "Internet Plus" era, teachers and students must develop the ability to adapt to rapidly changing environments. This includes fostering a mindset of "one specialty and multiple competencies," which encourages students to be versatile and open to continuous learning(Weiland, 2023).
    
- **Critical Thinking and Creativity**: Critical thinking is essential for problem-solving and innovation. It should be integrated across all subjects to enhance students' understanding and application of knowledge. Creativity, closely linked with critical thinking, can be fostered through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and innovative teaching methods(Mikhailova, 2021) (Vincent-Lancrin, 2023).
    
- **Sustainability and Values Education**: Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) emphasizes the importance of values and critical consciousness. By integrating sustainability into the curriculum, students learn to apply values in transforming their environment, contributing to a sustainable future(Minott & Minott, 2022) (Baena-Morales & Fröberg, 2023).
    
- **Complex Thinking**: This involves developing high cognitive capacities, including critical, systemic, and scientific thinking. Early development of these skills can lead to a cascade effect, enhancing overall competence and preparing students for complex future scenarios(Talamás-Carvajal et al., 2024).
    

## Integrating Values, Interpersonal Skills, and Critical Thinking

- **Curricular Reforms and Pedagogical Practices**: Schools should move away from static curricula to dynamic approaches that allow exploration and adaptation. This includes incorporating project-based learning and transformative pedagogies that empower students to take agency in their learning(Teschers et al., 2024) (Leite et al., 2022).
    
- **Teacher Training and Support**: Teachers play a crucial role in integrating these competencies. Training programs should focus on equipping teachers with the skills to foster critical thinking, creativity, and values education. This includes using teacher-friendly rubrics and formative assessments to guide lesson planning and evaluation(Vincent-Lancrin, 2023).
    
- **Cultural and Contextual Adaptation**: Educational practices should be adapted to local contexts, taking into account cultural values and societal needs. This approach ensures that competencies are relevant and applicable to students' real-life situations(Duong et al., 2023).
    

## Broader Perspectives

While the integration of these competencies is crucial, it is important to recognize the challenges and limitations of current educational systems. Traditional schooling models may struggle to accommodate these changes due to rigid curricula and assessment methods. Additionally, the implementation of competency-based education varies across different cultural and educational contexts, requiring careful consideration and adaptation to ensure effectiveness(Teschers et al., 2024) (Duong et al., 2023). As education systems evolve, ongoing research and collaboration among educators, policymakers, and communities will be essential to prepare students for the future successfully.

### 8. Evaluating educational quality

**Research question:**
What indicators are most effective for evaluating the quality of education from early childhood to secondary school in terms of impact on students’ long-term success, and how does teacher training influence the comprehensive development of students at these crucial stages?

Evaluating the quality of education from early childhood to secondary school is crucial for understanding its impact on students' long-term success. Effective indicators for this evaluation include child-centeredness, teacher qualifications, and the quality of teacher-child interactions. Additionally, teacher training plays a significant role in the comprehensive development of students, influencing educational outcomes and holistic development. This response will explore these indicators and the influence of teacher training, drawing insights from the provided research papers.

## Key Indicators for Evaluating Education Quality

- **Child-Centeredness and Holistic Development**: In early childhood education, child-centered approaches and holistic development are critical indicators of quality. These approaches focus on the individual needs and development of each child, promoting long-term success by fostering cognitive, social, and emotional growth(Sağlam et al., 2023).
    
- **Teacher Qualifications and Interactions**: Teacher qualifications and the quality of teacher-child interactions are significant indicators of educational quality. High-quality interactions are linked to better learning outcomes and are considered as effective as more complex quality rating systems(Markowitz et al., 2020). Teacher education and workforce support are also crucial, as they directly impact the quality of education provided(Slicker et al., 2023).
    
- **Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS)**: QRIS are used to evaluate and improve early childhood education quality. Simplifying these systems to focus on fewer, more impactful indicators, such as teacher-child interactions, can effectively predict children's learning gains(Markowitz et al., 2020). Additionally, QRIS can incorporate standards for early childhood development and mental health, further enhancing educational quality(Hutchins et al., 2023).
    

## Influence of Teacher Training on Student Development

- **Professional Development Programs**: In-service teacher training programs, such as the Dialogic Pedagogical Gatherings, have shown to improve educational outcomes by enhancing teacher quality. These programs are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of quality education for all, emphasizing the importance of continuous professional development for teachers(Roca-Campos et al., 2021).
    
- **Optimizing Teacher Evaluation Systems**: The use of advanced methods like Fuzzy-DEMATEL and Backpropagation Neural Networks can optimize teacher evaluation systems, identifying key indicators that contribute to effective teaching. This optimization helps in maintaining the speed and accuracy of teacher evaluations, ultimately benefiting student outcomes(Qian et al., 2024).
    
- **Automated Evaluation Techniques**: Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks combined with optimization strategies, can enhance the accuracy of teaching quality evaluations. These techniques help in identifying the most prominent quality indicators, leading to improved educational practices(Guan, 2023).
    

## Broader Perspectives

While the focus on specific indicators and teacher training is essential, it is also important to consider the broader educational context. Cultural values, the centralization of the education system, and stakeholder expectations can influence perceptions of quality in education(Sağlam et al., 2023). Additionally, the integration of quality measurement with governance and support systems is crucial for sustainable improvements in educational quality(English et al., 2023). These broader factors highlight the complexity of evaluating educational quality and the need for a comprehensive approach that considers various contextual elements.

In conclusion, evaluating the quality of education requires a focus on key indicators such as child-centeredness, teacher qualifications, and teacher-child interactions. Teacher training significantly influences student development, with professional development programs and optimized evaluation systems playing vital roles. However, a holistic approach that considers broader educational contexts and integrates quality measurement with governance is essential for achieving long-term success in education.
