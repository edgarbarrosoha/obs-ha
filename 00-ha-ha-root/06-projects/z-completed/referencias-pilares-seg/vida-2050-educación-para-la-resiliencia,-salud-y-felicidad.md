### 1. Impact of well-being on academic performance

**Research question:**
How does physical and emotional well-being influence students' academic performance and learning ability, and what indicators of mental and physical health best predict academic success and long-term well-being at different educational levels?

The relationship between physical and emotional well-being and students' academic performance is multifaceted, with various indicators of mental and physical health predicting academic success and long-term well-being across different educational levels. Research consistently shows that both physical and mental health significantly influence students' learning abilities and academic outcomes. This answer explores the key aspects of this relationship, highlighting the most predictive indicators of academic success and well-being.
## Physical and Emotional Well-being and Academic Performance

- **Mental Health and Academic Achievement**: Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are strongly linked to academic difficulties. For instance, children with emotional problems, including anxiety and depression, tend to have poorer academic outcomes, particularly in numeracy(Mundy et al., 2022). Similarly, mental health problems in early childhood and adolescence are associated with lower academic performance, emphasizing the need for early intervention(Agnafors et al., 2021).
    
- **Physical Health and Academic Role Impairment**: Physical health also plays a crucial role in academic performance. A study using the SF-12 Health Survey found that both physical and mental health scores were inversely related to academic role impairment, with mental health having a more substantial impact(Wilks et al., 2020). Physical exercise is associated with improved mental health, self-esteem, and school performance, highlighting the importance of physical activity in enhancing academic outcomes(Theodoratou et al., 2016).
## Indicators of Health Predicting Academic Success

- **Self-Perceived Health**: Self-perceived health, particularly in psychosocial dimensions, significantly affects academic performance trajectories. Children with lower self-perceived health scores are more likely to experience educational risks(Degoy et al., 2021). This suggests that self-perception, autonomy, and school environment are critical indicators of academic success.
    
- **Cognitive and Psychological Well-being**: Cognitive well-being is positively related to academic achievement, while psychological stress can sometimes correlate with higher performance due to increased motivation(Klapp et al., 2023). However, persistent psychological stress can lead to burnout and decreased performance over time.
    
- **Self-Regulated Learning**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, self-regulated learning emerged as a mediator between mental health and academic achievement. Students with better self-regulation skills were able to maintain academic performance despite mental health challenges(Xue, 2023).
    

## Long-term Well-being and Educational Levels

- **University Students**: At the university level, mental health issues are prevalent and significantly impact academic outcomes. International students, in particular, face unique challenges, such as acculturative stress and limited access to health services, which can affect their academic performance(Sanci et al., 2022).
    
- **Secondary School Students**: In secondary education, positive dimensions of well-being, such as enjoyment in school and a positive academic self-concept, are linked to better academic achievement. Conversely, negative dimensions, like worries and social problems, do not show a direct association with academic outcomes(Morinaj & Hascher, 2022).
## Broader Perspectives

While the relationship between well-being and academic performance is well-documented, it is essential to consider the broader educational and social context. For instance, changes in educational systems and assessment methods can influence students' well-being and academic outcomes(Klapp et al., 2023). Additionally, health education and policies promoting physical activity can enhance students' psychological well-being and academic performance, suggesting a need for integrated health and education strategies(Sun et al., 2024). These insights underscore the importance of a holistic approach to student well-being, considering both mental and physical health as integral to academic success and long-term well-being.

### 2. Developing resilience through education

**Research question:**
What are the most effective educational strategies to develop emotional resilience in students from primary to secondary education, and how can this resilience prepare them to face future challenges in their personal and professional lives?

Developing emotional resilience in students from primary to secondary education is crucial for preparing them to face future personal and professional challenges. Effective educational strategies for building resilience include interventions that enhance cognitive flexibility, emotional intelligence, and emotion regulation, as well as the use of high-fidelity simulations and trauma-informed practices. These strategies not only foster resilience but also equip students with the skills necessary to navigate complex and stressful situations in their future lives.

## Cognitive Flexibility and Character Strengths

- Cognitive flexibility is a significant predictor of resilience, as it facilitates adaptive thinking and problem-solving in challenging situations. Interventions that focus on character strengths, such as those grounded in positive psychology, have been shown to enhance both cognitive flexibility and resilience in pre-service teachers. This approach can be adapted for students, helping them develop a mindset that supports resilience(Janapati & Vijayalakshmi, 2024).

## Emotional Intelligence and Self-Efficacy

- Emotional intelligence plays a mediating role between self-efficacy and resilience. Programs that enhance students' emotional intelligence can indirectly boost their resilience by improving their ability to manage emotions and maintain self-efficacy. This is particularly effective in secondary vocational students, where emotional intelligence helps bridge the gap between self-belief and resilience(Jiang, 2024).

## Emotion Regulation Strategies

- Emotion regulation is critical for resilience, with antecedent-focused strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) being more effective than response-focused strategies (e.g., expressive suppression). Teachers and students who employ these strategies experience lower levels of burnout and higher occupational well-being, which are essential components of resilience(Li et al., 2023).

## High-Fidelity Simulation and Trauma-Informed Practices

- High-fidelity simulations provide realistic scenarios that help students develop emotional preparedness and mental resilience. This method is particularly effective in fields like trauma management, where students must be ready to face high-pressure situations. Such simulations can be adapted for educational settings to prepare students for various life challenges(Newton & Smith, 2024).
- Trauma-informed practices emphasize the role of social relationships and communication in building resilience. By fostering supportive environments and teaching students to seek and provide social support, these practices enhance resilience and help students cope with stress and trauma(Raptis, 2023).

## Spaced Education and Mobile-Assisted Learning

- Spaced education, delivered through mobile applications, has been effective in enhancing resilience by providing continuous, accessible learning opportunities. This method allows students to engage with resilience-building content at their own pace, reinforcing their learning and application of resilience strategies(Lim et al., 2024).

## Resilience-Based Interventions

- Resilience-based interventions that focus on emotional regulation, grit, and life satisfaction have shown significant improvements in these areas among nursing students. Such interventions can be adapted for younger students to build foundational resilience skills that will benefit them throughout their education and beyond(Khedr et al., 2023).

While these strategies are effective, it is important to consider the individual and environmental factors that influence resilience. Personal traits such as self-efficacy and flexibility, along with supportive social environments, play a crucial role in how students develop and apply resilience. Additionally, resilience is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it must be tailored to the unique needs and contexts of each student population(Raptis, 2023).

### 3. Mental health and its relationship with learning

**Research question:**
How does the integration of mental health programs in schools affect the cognitive and emotional development of students, and what early interventions are most effective in preventing emotional problems that interfere with their learning?

The integration of mental health programs in schools significantly impacts the cognitive and emotional development of students by providing early interventions that prevent emotional problems from interfering with learning. These programs, when effectively implemented, can enhance mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and promote help-seeking behaviors, thereby fostering a supportive environment for cognitive and emotional growth. The following sections explore the effects of these programs and identify effective early interventions.

## Impact on Cognitive and Emotional Development

- **Universal Design for Learning Framework**: Implementing a universal design for learning framework in schools can address barriers to mental health care and promote early intervention. This approach helps in integrating mental health support into the educational environment, thereby improving both cognitive and emotional outcomes for students(Pereira & Ith, 2024).
- **Transdiagnostic Interventions**: Universal school-based transdiagnostic interventions have shown small to medium effect sizes in promoting mental health and emotional well-being. These interventions cover a broad range of mental health aspects, although their effectiveness varies depending on whether they are led by teachers or psychologists(Wang et al., 2024).
- **Mental Health Literacy Programs**: Programs that enhance mental health literacy in schools have been effective in improving knowledge and help-seeking attitudes among students. These interventions also reduce stigma and stress, contributing to better emotional development(Wei et al., 2024) (of et al., 2023).

## Effective Early Interventions

- **Emotion Regulation and Resilience Building**: School-based programs focusing on emotion regulation and resilience have been effective in reducing psychological distress and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. These programs are particularly beneficial for students with a history of NSSI, highlighting the importance of early intervention in preventing severe mental health issues(Baetens et al., 2024).
- **Achievement Goals and Depression**: Targeting achievement goals within the school environment can help prevent depression in adolescents. Programs that focus on mastery goals, such as learning skills and understanding subjects, rather than peer comparison, have shown potential in reducing depressive symptoms(Li & Werner-Seidler, 2024).
- **Technology-Supported Cooperative Learning**: This approach has demonstrated significant improvements in peer relations and reductions in victimization and mental health problems. By fostering positive peer interactions, technology-supported cooperative learning can serve as an effective early intervention strategy(Zagni & Ryzin, 2024).

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Cultural and Demographic Factors**: The effectiveness of mental health interventions can vary based on cultural and demographic factors. For instance, English proficiency and ethnicity have been linked to different outcomes in mental health literacy programs, suggesting the need for tailored interventions to address diverse student populations(Wei et al., 2024).
- **Sustainability of Interventions**: While programs like the HeadStart initiative have shown initial success in reducing exclusions, their effects may be transient without sustained funding and support. This underscores the importance of long-term commitment to mental health interventions in schools(Cattan et al., 2023).

In conclusion, while school-based mental health programs have shown promise in enhancing cognitive and emotional development, their success depends on various factors, including the type of intervention, the role of educators, and the cultural context. Future research should focus on optimizing these programs to ensure they are inclusive and sustainable, thereby maximizing their impact on student well-being.

### 4. Healthy educational environments

**Research question:**
What characteristics should an educational environment have to promote the physical and mental health of students, and how do physical spaces and school policies influence their general well-being and development?

Creating an educational environment that promotes the physical and mental health of students involves a multifaceted approach, integrating well-designed physical spaces and supportive school policies. These elements significantly influence students' general well-being and development. The following sections explore the characteristics of such environments and the impact of physical spaces and school policies on student health and development.

## Characteristics of a Health-Promoting Educational Environment

- **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ):** Good IAQ is crucial for student health and academic performance. High levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) can negatively impact students' cognitive functions and health. Effective ventilation systems and air cleaning technologies are essential to maintain optimal IAQ(Branco et al., 2024) (Sadrizadeh et al., 2022).
- **Thermal Comfort and Ventilation:** Adequate ventilation and thermal comfort are necessary to prevent respiratory diseases and enhance learning outcomes. Natural ventilation can be energy-efficient but may not always suffice, especially in extreme climates. Therefore, a balance between natural and mechanical ventilation is recommended(Toyinbo, 2023) (Sadrizadeh et al., 2022).
- **Physical Space Design:** Classrooms should be spacious, well-lit, and designed to reduce noise, which can distract students and hinder learning. Enclosed classrooms have been shown to improve reading fluency compared to open-plan designs, particularly for students with attention difficulties(Rance et al., 2023).
- **Natural Elements and Aesthetics:** Incorporating natural elements and aesthetically pleasing designs can enhance students' comfort and engagement. Issues like high temperatures and poor air quality, as noted in some Chinese schools, highlight the need for redesigning learning spaces to improve naturalness and comfort(Sun & Aziz, 2024).

## Influence of Physical Spaces on Well-being

- **Physical Activity Spaces:** Schools should provide diverse indoor and outdoor spaces that encourage physical activity. These spaces should be multifunctional and adaptable to different activities and seasons, promoting both physical health and social interaction(Pardali, 2023).
- **Social-Emotional Climate (SEC):** A positive SEC, characterized by supportive relationships and inclusive policies, can significantly enhance mental health. Interventions that integrate SEC components have shown improvements in mental health outcomes(Hawkins et al., 2023).

## Impact of School Policies on Student Development

- **Health Education Policies:** Implementing comprehensive health education policies can significantly improve students' psychological well-being. These policies should include sustainable health exercises and sports participation to foster a holistic approach to student health(Sun et al., 2024).
- **Mental Health Interventions:** Structural and cultural interventions, such as positive classroom management and peer mentoring, are effective in promoting mental health. However, there is a need for more targeted interventions to address mental health inequalities(Troy et al., 2022).
- **Community Involvement:** Engaging parents and the broader community in school health initiatives can create a supportive environment that enhances students' psychological well-being(Pérez-Ordás et al., 2022).

While the focus on physical and mental health in educational settings is crucial, it is important to consider the broader socio-economic and cultural contexts. For instance, interventions must be tailored to address specific regional challenges, such as proximity to pollution sources or socio-economic disparities, to be truly effective(Sadrizadeh et al., 2022). Additionally, the integration of emerging technologies and innovative design solutions can further enhance the learning environment, although these require careful consideration of energy efficiency and environmental impact(Branco et al., 2024) (Sadrizadeh et al., 2022).

### 5. Promoting happiness in education

**Research question:**
What pedagogical practices contribute to the development of happiness and well-being in students, and how can these results be measured objectively, without compromising academic rigor?

The development of happiness and well-being in students through pedagogical practices is a multifaceted endeavor that involves integrating positive psychology, fostering digital well-being, and enhancing social support systems. These practices can be objectively measured through various innovative approaches without compromising academic rigor. The following sections explore key pedagogical practices and measurement strategies that contribute to student well-being.

## Positive Pedagogy and Well-being Models

- Positive pedagogy, which integrates positive psychology into education, is crucial for enhancing student well-being. The integration of the PERMA model (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) with experiential learning models like the 5E model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) can effectively impart well-being-rich content in classrooms(Pant & Rastogi, 2024).
- Positive education programs utilize empirically proven methods to improve well-being, engagement, optimism, and life satisfaction, which are essential for both academic achievement and psychological well-being(Shilko et al., 2022).

## Digital Well-being Education

- Educating students on digital well-being, rather than merely restricting technology use, can foster personal growth and inspire students to design technologies that promote social good. A case study in an Italian university demonstrated that a multidisciplinary course on digital well-being positively impacted students, encouraging them to create sustainable design practices(Roffarello & Russis, 2023).

## Curriculum-Embedded Well-being Approaches

- Embedding well-being into the curriculum through appropriate teaching, pedagogy, and assessment practices can significantly support student well-being. Students benefit from being academically challenged when supported appropriately, and strong peer and teacher-student interactions are crucial for learning and well-being(Upsher et al., 2022).
- Personal development activities, such as those integrated into English language curricula, can enhance students' mental and physical health, preparing them for future challenges(Orosz, 2024).

## Social Support and Peer Relationships

- Effective social support from teachers, peers, and guardians is vital for promoting study well-being. Different profiles of social support have varying impacts on study engagement and burnout, highlighting the importance of maintaining robust support systems throughout students' educational journeys(Ulmanen et al., 2022).
- Peer-supported teaching practices, which emphasize relational peer-review processes, can enhance educator and student well-being by fostering growth-fostering relationships(Hansen et al., 2023).

## Measuring Well-being

- The development of a multi-dimensional scale for student well-being (SWB) that includes academic, financial, physical, psychological resilience, and relational well-being provides a comprehensive tool for measuring and improving well-being in higher education(Khatri et al., 2024).
- Pedagogic partnerships, which involve students in the learning process and encourage emotional awareness, can promote resilience and enhance well-being. These partnerships can be developed to support the well-being of modern-day higher education communities(Hill et al., 2021).

While these pedagogical practices offer promising avenues for enhancing student well-being, it is essential to consider the broader socio-cultural contexts in which they are implemented. For instance, the concept of "killjoy pedagogy" critiques the simplistic association of happiness with effective pedagogy, highlighting the need to address underlying cultural and social hierarchies that may affect student well-being("Killjoy pedagogy and the politics of a smile", 2023). This perspective reminds educators to remain critical and reflective in their approaches to fostering happiness and well-being in educational settings.

### 6. Education for health and well-being

**Research question:**
How can the principles of physical and emotional health education be integrated into the school curriculum to encourage healthy habits, and what programs have been shown to be effective in promoting long-term well-being?

Integrating principles of physical and emotional health education into school curricula is essential for fostering healthy habits and promoting long-term well-being among students. Effective programs often combine social-emotional learning (SEL) with physical activity (PA) and are designed to be sustainable and adaptable to various school environments. This response explores how these principles can be integrated and highlights successful programs that have demonstrated positive outcomes.

## Integration of Health Education Principles

- **Whole-Child Health and Wellness Curriculum**: A study involving 45 elementary schools implemented a curriculum that integrated SEL skills such as mindfulness, compassion, and physical awareness. This approach aimed to enhance academic engagement, personal well-being, and student behavior. The program showed significant effects, particularly in high-poverty communities, indicating the importance of tailoring interventions to meet specific needs(Tolan et al., 2024).
    
- **Holistic and Multi-Level Approaches**: The "Commit to Be Fit" (C2BF) framework exemplifies a holistic approach by addressing individual, home, school, and community levels. This initiative includes activities in cafeterias, classrooms, and communities, creating a culture of wellness. Leadership engagement and alignment with school priorities were critical for its success(Redelfs et al., 2023).
    
- **Dual-Approach of Physical Activity and Diet**: A systematic review highlights the effectiveness of combining physical activity and dietary interventions to maintain a healthy body mass index in children. This dual-approach is promising for promoting sustainable health behaviors(Tanous et al., 2022).
    

## Effective Programs and Strategies

- **Mindfulness and Yoga-Based Interventions**: Programs like "Pure Power" that incorporate yoga and mindfulness have shown improvements in coping skills, socio-emotional competence, and academic performance. Training school staff to deliver these interventions can enhance implementation fidelity(McCurdy et al., 2024).
    
- **Systems Approach for Health Promotion**: The Data Health study applied a systems approach using Group Model Building sessions to promote health among vocational students. This participatory method involved students, staff, and community members, although challenges in staff recruitment were noted(Heinze et al., 2023).
    
- **Employee Health and Well-Being Programs**: Schools can learn from workplace health programs to support staff well-being, which indirectly benefits students. Multicomponent interventions have been shown to improve health behaviors and outcomes among employees(Barnes & Lang, 2023).
    

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Implementation Challenges**: Real-world studies, such as the Healthy Primary School of the Future initiative, faced implementation challenges due to external factors like COVID-19. These challenges highlight the need for adaptable and resilient program designs(Hahnraths et al., 2023).
    
- **Cultural and Policy Considerations**: In regions like China, health education significantly impacts students' psychological well-being. Sustainable health exercises and sports participation play a moderating role, suggesting that government policies should support these activities(Sun et al., 2024).
    

While integrating health education into school curricula is beneficial, it requires careful consideration of local contexts, resources, and stakeholder engagement. Programs must be flexible to adapt to changing circumstances and diverse student needs. Additionally, ongoing research and evaluation are crucial to refine these interventions and ensure their effectiveness in promoting long-term well-being.

### 7. Balancing academic success and emotional well-being

**Research question:**
How can the pursuit of academic excellence be balanced with the promotion of mental health and well-being in high-achieving students, and what effects does academic pressure have on their mental health?

Balancing academic excellence with mental health and well-being in high-achieving students is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Academic pressure can significantly impact students' mental health, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. However, strategic interventions and supportive educational practices can help mitigate these effects and promote a healthier balance between academic success and mental well-being.

## Academic Pressure and Its Impact on Mental Health

- **Performance Pressure**: The transformation of economies into knowledge-based systems has increased the emphasis on educational performance, leading to heightened pressure on students. In Denmark, educational reforms have introduced performance monitoring and self-evaluation, which contribute to structural performance pressure and support the educational stressors hypothesis(Jacobsen, 2024).
- **Peer Influence**: In South Korea, students who attended private educational institutes before primary school experience greater exam-related pressure, which negatively affects their peers' mental well-being. This spillover effect is more pronounced in competitive regions and among students with high parental expectations("Students under academic pressure and their spillover effects on peers’ mental well-being", 2024).
- **Gender Differences**: Among high-performing engineering students in Chile, female students reported more mental health concerns and lower levels of hope compared to their male counterparts. However, these mental health issues did not correlate with academic achievement, suggesting that high academic performance can occur independently of mental well-being(J-F et al., 2024).

## Strategies for Balancing Academic Excellence and Mental Health

- **Teaching Practices**: In Sweden, student-centered teaching practices are associated with both academic achievement and reduced mental health complaints. Conversely, teacher-centered practices, while beneficial for academic success, do not significantly impact mental health. This highlights the importance of adopting teaching methods that support both academic and mental well-being(Bortes & Giota, 2024).
- **Music Education**: In China, music education interventions have been effective in alleviating anxiety and depression among university students. Strategies such as music appreciation and music-based self-care have been identified as particularly beneficial, emphasizing the role of creative activities in promoting mental health(He et al., 2024).
- **Protective Factors**: In Australia, protective factors such as maintaining perspective and building networks have been shown to positively influence mental well-being and reduce stress. Universities are encouraged to develop these protective factors to help students manage academic stress and enhance their overall well-being(Turner & Holdsworth, 2024).

## The Role of Educational Environment

- **School Environment**: In Norway, attending higher achievement schools is associated with increased enrollment in higher education and a decreased likelihood of psychological conditions. This suggests that the educational environment, including teacher and peer characteristics, plays a crucial role in shaping students' mental health outcomes(Bütikofer et al., 2023).
- **Stress Management**: Among nursing students, there is a strong relationship between higher education stress, academic goal orientation, and mental health. Interventions that help students regulate stress and set clear academic goals can improve mental health outcomes(Ji et al., 2024).

While academic pressure can have detrimental effects on students' mental health, it is important to recognize that not all stress is harmful. Some students may thrive under pressure, using it as a motivator for success. However, educational institutions must ensure that the pressure does not become overwhelming and that students have access to resources and support systems to maintain their mental well-being. By fostering a supportive educational environment and implementing targeted interventions, it is possible to achieve a balance between academic excellence and mental health.

### 8. Impact of comprehensive well-being on professional life

**Research question:**
How does a focus on emotional health and well-being during education influence long-term career resilience and success, and what skills related to stress management and well-being should be taught to prepare students for future work challenges?

Focusing on emotional health and well-being during education significantly influences long-term career resilience and success. By equipping students with stress management and well-being skills, educational institutions can prepare them for future work challenges. This approach not only enhances individual resilience but also contributes to a healthier, more productive workforce. The following sections explore the impact of emotional health on career resilience, the skills necessary for managing stress, and the role of educational institutions in fostering these competencies.

## Impact of Emotional Health on Career Resilience

- Emotional regulation skills are crucial in managing stress and preventing burnout, particularly in high-stress professions like teaching. For instance, STEM teachers who effectively regulate their emotions experience lower stress levels and higher well-being, which in turn reduces burnout and enhances career resilience(Farhi & Rubinsten, 2024).
- In higher education, staff who perceive their mental health positively are more likely to exhibit resilient coping mechanisms, which are essential for career longevity and success(Rahman et al., 2024).
- The Coping Reservoir Model illustrates that students who engage in adaptive coping mechanisms can foster resilience and reduce burnout, thereby enhancing their capacity to handle future professional challenges(El-Awaisi et al., 2023).

## Skills for Stress Management and Well-being

- Positive psychology interventions, such as those taught in psychoeducational courses, can improve mental well-being. However, the long-term benefits are sustained only if students continue to practice these skills, highlighting the importance of ongoing engagement in stress management activities(Hobbs et al., 2024).
- Protective factors, such as maintaining perspective and building networks, are associated with reduced stress and improved mental well-being among university students. These skills are vital for managing stress in academic and professional settings(Turner & Holdsworth, 2024).
- The integration of eHealth solutions, such as IoT devices for real-time monitoring of stress indicators, can provide students and educators with personalized feedback and interventions, promoting proactive stress management(Sergio et al., 2024).

## Role of Educational Institutions

- Educational institutions play a pivotal role in fostering well-being by integrating emotional health and stress management into curricula. This approach not only supports student well-being but also prepares them for the demands of the workforce(Khatri et al., 2024).
- A systems approach to educator well-being, which includes addressing work system factors and providing emotional wellness training, can enhance both educator and student success(Laundon & Grant-Smith, 2023).
- Institutions should create supportive environments that prioritize teacher and student well-being, recognizing the interconnectedness of educator health and student outcomes(Assali & Abdouli, 2024).

While the focus on emotional health and well-being is crucial, it is important to acknowledge potential challenges. For instance, the effectiveness of well-being interventions can vary based on individual engagement and institutional support. Additionally, while technology offers innovative solutions for stress management, it also raises concerns about privacy and data security. Therefore, a balanced approach that considers these factors is essential for maximizing the benefits of emotional health initiatives in education.

### 9. Promoting physical health at school

**Research question:**
Which physical education activities and programs have the greatest impact on students' health and well-being, also improving their academic performance, and how can they promote mental well-being and social cohesion?

Physical education activities and programs play a crucial role in enhancing students' health, well-being, and academic performance. These programs not only improve physical health but also contribute to mental well-being and social cohesion among students. The following sections explore the impact of various physical education activities and programs, highlighting their benefits and implementation strategies.

## Impact on Health and Well-being

- **Health Education and Exercise**: Health education combined with sustainable exercise and sports participation significantly improves the psychological well-being of school students. This approach emphasizes the importance of integrating health education into school curricula to enhance students' mental health(Sun et al., 2024).
- **Structured Exercise Programs**: In higher education settings, structured exercise programs have been shown to effectively address mental health challenges. These programs focus on behavior change, exercise adherence, and integration with other campus services, promoting overall student well-being(Furzer et al., 2023).
- **Near-Peer Mentorship**: Programs like the Up2Us Sports SBYD, which employ near-peer coaches, provide a supportive environment that promotes physical activity and life skills development. These programs are particularly effective in under-resourced communities, enhancing both physical and mental health(St-Pierre et al., 2024).

## Academic Performance Enhancement

- **Physically Active Learning (PAL)**: Integrating physical activity with academic learning, as seen in PAL programs, has been shown to improve both health and academic outcomes. These programs encourage active participation and engagement, leading to better academic performance(Simard et al., 2023).
- **Classroom-Based Physical Activity (CBPA)**: CBPA interventions, which incorporate physical activity into classroom settings, have been found to improve academic performance. Elements such as moderate intensity and longer duration of activities contribute to these positive outcomes(Wu et al., 2023).

## Promotion of Mental Well-being and Social Cohesion

- **Peer-Led Physical Activity**: Programs like Fitness Buddies (FB) focus on peer-led physical activities to combat loneliness and stress among college students. These programs foster social connections and a sense of belonging, which are crucial for mental well-being(Kirby et al., 2022).
- **In-School and After-School Programs**: The transition of physical activity programs from after-school to in-school settings can enhance student motivation and social outcomes. Positive student-teacher interactions and satisfaction of psychological needs are key factors in promoting mental well-being(He et al., 2023).

## Broader Perspectives

While physical education programs have demonstrated significant benefits, challenges such as limited resources and traditional institutional structures can hinder their effectiveness. Addressing these barriers through innovative strategies and policy changes is essential for maximizing the impact of these programs(He et al., 2023). Additionally, the integration of technology and personalized learning approaches, such as those using deep learning, can further enhance student engagement and participation in physical activities(Hao et al., 2021). Overall, a comprehensive approach that combines physical education with supportive environments and tailored interventions can significantly improve students' health, well-being, and academic success.

### 10. Assessing comprehensive well-being in education

**Research question:**
What tools and methodologies can be used to comprehensively assess the physical and emotional well-being of students within the educational environment, and how can the impact of educational policies focused on health and well-being on their long-term academic and personal outcomes be measured?

To comprehensively assess the physical and emotional well-being of students within educational environments, a variety of tools and methodologies can be employed. These tools not only measure well-being but also help in evaluating the impact of educational policies on students' long-term academic and personal outcomes. The following sections outline the key methodologies and tools, as well as approaches to measure the impact of health-focused educational policies.

## Tools and Methodologies for Assessing Student Well-being

- **Multi-dimensional Well-being Scales**: The development of comprehensive scales, such as the Student Well-being (SWB) scale, is crucial for capturing the multifaceted nature of student well-being. This scale includes dimensions like academic, financial, physical, psychological resilience, and relational well-being, providing a sophisticated tool for higher education contexts(Khatri et al., 2024).
    
- **Universal Well-being Screening**: The Student Subjective Wellbeing Questionnaire (SSWQ) is a validated tool used in schools to screen for positive well-being and identify mental health needs. It supports data-driven decisions for interventions, ensuring that students receive appropriate support based on their well-being status(Cunha et al., 2024).
    
- **Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) Model**: This model emphasizes the integration of health-related practices across school policies. Tools like the Wellness School Assessment Tool (WellSAT) WSCC help schools align their policies with this model, promoting a holistic approach to student well-being(Schwartz et al., 2023).
    
- **Environmental Stress Assessment**: Structural equation modeling can be used to assess the impact of environmental stressors on students' physical and emotional well-being. This approach helps in understanding the pathways through which stress affects health, providing insights for targeted interventions(Cantuaria et al., 2023).
    

## Measuring the Impact of Educational Policies

- **Longitudinal Studies and Meta-analyses**: These studies provide insights into the antecedents and consequences of student well-being, highlighting factors like self-esteem, emotional regulation, and social support that can be targeted for interventions. They also show how well-being influences academic outcomes, offering a basis for policy evaluation("A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies of the antecedents and consequences of wellbeing among university students", 2022).
    
- **Natural Experiment Evaluation Methods**: Techniques such as difference-in-difference analysis can be used to evaluate the impact of policies on health outcomes. This approach helps in understanding the real-world effects of policies, ensuring they are equitable and effective(Widome, 2022).
    
- **Case Studies and Qualitative Research**: In-depth case studies, such as those examining student voice initiatives, provide qualitative insights into how well-being-focused practices are enacted in schools. These studies reveal the complexities of implementing such initiatives and their potential to address or exacerbate inequalities(Finneran, 2024).
    

## Broader Perspectives on Well-being and Policy Impact

While the tools and methodologies discussed provide robust frameworks for assessing and enhancing student well-being, it is important to consider the broader context. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for adaptive policies that address emerging challenges in student well-being. Research indicates that satisfaction with institutional interventions during the pandemic significantly predicts student well-being, underscoring the importance of responsive and supportive educational policies(Wildschut & Fadiji, 2024). Additionally, the school environment, including physical and social-emotional components, plays a critical role in shaping both student and employee health, suggesting that interventions should be comprehensive and inclusive(Hawkins et al., 2023).

In conclusion, a combination of quantitative and qualitative tools, along with a holistic policy approach, is essential for effectively assessing and enhancing student well-being in educational settings. These methodologies not only provide a comprehensive understanding of well-being but also guide the development of policies that support long-term academic and personal success.
