### 1. Promoting a culture of innovation through education

**Research question:**
What are the most effective educational strategies to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in primary, secondary and higher education students, and how does teaching entrepreneurial skills from an early age influence their ability to generate innovative solutions to complex problems?

Promoting a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in education requires a multifaceted approach that integrates theoretical knowledge with practical experiences. Effective educational strategies span across primary, secondary, and higher education levels, focusing on developing entrepreneurial skills from an early age. These strategies not only enhance students' ability to generate innovative solutions to complex problems but also foster a mindset conducive to entrepreneurship.

## Integration of Theory and Practice

- **Discipline Competitions**: Implementing discipline competitions in higher education, such as those in food science and engineering, bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. These competitions encourage students to engage in innovative practices and develop problem-solving skills by participating in a "theory + experiment + practice" model. This approach fosters a sustainable innovation culture and prepares students to tackle complex real-world problems(Kong et al., 2024).
- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and STEM**: In higher education, PBL and STEM activities are effective in transitioning from theoretical to hands-on learning. These methods encourage students to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges, such as environmental protection, thereby enhancing their entrepreneurial skills and innovation capabilities(Gómez, 2024).

## Entrepreneurial Identity and Intention

- **Entrepreneurial Identity Development**: Programs like the PEIEO, which focus on developing entrepreneurial identity, have shown to increase entrepreneurial potential among young people. These programs enhance traits such as creativity, leadership, and self-efficacy, which are crucial for fostering an entrepreneurial mindset(Valle et al., 2024).
- **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)**: The TPB framework highlights the importance of personal attitudes and perceived behavioral control in shaping entrepreneurial intentions. Cultural factors, such as valuing change and originality, also play a significant role in influencing students' entrepreneurial intentions across different cultural contexts(Paiva et al., 2024).

## Technological Integration and Curriculum Innovation

- **AI and Data-Driven Approaches**: The integration of AI and data-driven methods in education, such as using predictive models and online teaching systems, enhances the teaching and learning of innovation and entrepreneurship. These technologies facilitate personalized learning experiences and improve students' performance in entrepreneurial courses(Lian & Zhang, 2024) (Liu et al., 2024).
- **Multivariate Data Chain Networks**: Utilizing advanced data networks to tailor educational content to students' interests can significantly improve their engagement and competence in innovation and entrepreneurship(Yan & Wang, 2024).

## Cultural and Environmental Influences

- **Cultural Diversity**: Exposure to cultural diversity in educational settings can enhance students' innovation orientation. Diverse environments encourage unique perspectives and creative problem-solving approaches, which are essential for innovative entrepreneurship(Prenzel et al., 2024).
- **Sustainability and Environmental Awareness**: While environmental awareness alone may not directly influence entrepreneurial intentions, integrating sustainability into entrepreneurship education can broaden students' understanding of social and environmental impacts, thereby enriching their entrepreneurial endeavors(Paiva et al., 2024).

In contrast, some challenges remain in effectively implementing these strategies across different educational levels and cultural contexts. For instance, while discipline competitions and PBL are effective in higher education, adapting these methods for younger students requires careful consideration of age-appropriate content and activities. Additionally, the integration of technology in education, while beneficial, necessitates adequate training for educators to effectively utilize these tools(Wang, 2024) (Cao et al., 2024). Overall, a comprehensive approach that combines practical experiences, cultural diversity, and technological advancements is essential for cultivating a robust culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in education.

### 2. Innovation with social and environmental impact

**Research question:**
What skills should students develop to design innovative solutions that address local and global social and environmental problems, and how can academic entrepreneurship initiatives contribute to environmental sustainability and the development of vulnerable communities in Guanajuato?

To design innovative solutions addressing local and global social and environmental problems, students should develop a range of skills, including entrepreneurial, creative, and sustainability-oriented competencies. Academic entrepreneurship initiatives can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability and the development of vulnerable communities, such as those in Guanajuato, by fostering these skills and facilitating practical applications. The following sections elaborate on the necessary skills and the role of academic entrepreneurship in achieving these goals.

## Essential Skills for Innovative Solutions

- **Entrepreneurial Skills**: Developing entrepreneurial skills is crucial for students to contribute to local economic development and address broader social challenges. These skills include self-consciousness, innovation, and environmental commitment, which are essential for fostering sustainability and sustainable development(Bardales-Cárdenas et al., 2024) (Fabregá et al., 2020). Entrepreneurial education, particularly when integrated with sustainability goals, can enhance students' ability to generate sustainable business ideas that address local and global problems(Castro & Zermeño, 2021).
    
- **Creativity and Innovation**: Creativity and innovation are vital for tackling complex environmental and social issues. Educational initiatives like the CHET Project emphasize the importance of embedding creativity in university curricula to prepare students for the challenges outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development(García-Aranda et al., 2020). Similarly, training in biomimicry and creative problem-solving processes can equip students with the skills needed to design eco-innovative products, even without a background in natural sciences("Training for Sustainability through Biomimicry and Creative Problem-Solving Processes", 2023).
    
- **Transdisciplinary Competencies**: Addressing multifaceted issues such as urban sustainability requires a transdisciplinary approach. Programs that integrate training across various disciplines enable students to communicate, collaborate, and innovate effectively in diverse contexts(Li, 2022). This approach is crucial for developing leaders who can tackle complex problems in urban and rural settings.
    

## Role of Academic Entrepreneurship Initiatives

- **Sustainability and Community Development**: Academic entrepreneurship initiatives can play a pivotal role in promoting environmental sustainability and community development. For instance, service-learning experiences in sustainability entrepreneurship have been shown to enhance students' social and sustainability commitment, as well as their professional skills(Martínez-Campillo et al., 2019). These initiatives can also facilitate the development of sustainable business plans that support local communities, particularly in rural areas.
    
- **Extracurricular Activities and Networking**: Extracurricular activities, such as meeting successful entrepreneurs and participating in entrepreneurial events, are effective in enhancing students' entrepreneurial competencies and intentions(Isac et al., 2023). These activities provide valuable networking opportunities and exposure to real-world challenges, which are essential for translating academic knowledge into practical solutions.
    
- **Integration of Entrepreneurial and Environmental Education**: The integration of entrepreneurial and environmental education in curricula is crucial for addressing urgent global challenges like climate change. Although current educational programs often lack explicit emphasis on these interdisciplinary themes, there is potential for more robust integration to promote sustainable development(Seikkula-Leino et al., 2021).
    

While the development of these skills and initiatives is promising, it is important to recognize the challenges and limitations in current educational systems. Many programs still lack explicit integration of entrepreneurial and sustainability education, and there is a need for more comprehensive methodologies to apply these concepts across various fields(Seikkula-Leino et al., 2021) ("Training for Sustainability through Biomimicry and Creative Problem-Solving Processes", 2023). Additionally, fostering a culture of innovation and sustainability requires collaboration among educational institutions, government, and the private sector to create supportive ecosystems for students and entrepreneurs alike(Bardales-Cárdenas et al., 2024).

### 3. Purpose-driven entrepreneurship

**Research question:**
How can the integration of ethical values ​​and social responsibility in the training of entrepreneurs generate a positive economic and social impact in the region, and what innovative business models, based on social purpose, have proven successful in Guanajuato and can be replicated in other contexts?

The integration of ethical values and social responsibility in entrepreneurial training can significantly enhance both economic and social impacts in a region. This approach not only fosters sustainable business practices but also encourages the development of innovative business models that address social issues. In Guanajuato, successful social-purpose business models have emerged, offering replicable frameworks for other regions. The following sections explore how ethical and socially responsible entrepreneurship can drive positive change and highlight successful models from Guanajuato.

## Integration of Ethical Values and Social Responsibility

- **Philosophical Approaches**: Social entrepreneurs often align more with philosophical approaches than traditional management theories. This alignment helps them navigate complex social issues and uncertainties, fostering a deeper commitment to ethical practices and social impact(Müller et al., 2023).
- **Training and Capacity Building**: Entrepreneurial training that emphasizes innovation and business ethics is crucial. Such training enhances entrepreneurial capacity, equipping entrepreneurs with the skills needed to integrate ethical values into their business models(Rodríguez-López & Souto, 2020).
- **Social Responsibility as Competitive Advantage**: For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), integrating social responsibility can be a source of competitive advantage. This integration often begins with internal changes and is accelerated by external events, such as economic disruptions(Reisinger & Szabo, 2024).

## Economic and Social Impact

- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Models**: In Guanajuato, the CSR model for SMEs emphasizes human capital, client relations, and community impact. This model provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various business structures, promoting economic development and social well-being(Ríos-Manríquez et al., 2021).
- **Poverty Reduction**: Social responsibility initiatives have been shown to reduce poverty levels by improving financial stability and creating opportunities for marginalized groups. This is particularly evident in sectors where businesses invest in social and environmental initiatives(Jakunskiene, 2021).

## Innovative Business Models in Guanajuato

- **Restorative Ventures**: These ventures focus on rehabilitating and integrating marginalized groups into the community. By engaging with diverse stakeholders and addressing social exclusion, restorative ventures create sustainable social impact(Awad et al., 2022).
- **Responsible Innovation**: Social entrepreneurs in Guanajuato have successfully integrated values into their innovations, creating business models that are both socially responsible and economically viable. This approach not only addresses local social issues but also provides a template for other regions to follow(Lubberink et al., 2019).

## Replicability and Broader Perspectives

- **Sustainable Entrepreneurial Culture**: Programs that promote sustainable entrepreneurship, such as those in the European Union, demonstrate the potential for educational initiatives to instill social responsibility in future entrepreneurs. These programs can be adapted to different cultural and economic contexts, including regions like Guanajuato(Sánchez-Hernández & Maldonado-Briegas, 2019).
- **Institutional Work and Ethical Dilemmas**: Social entrepreneurs often face ethical dilemmas in balancing social and commercial objectives. By engaging in institutional work, they can navigate these challenges and enhance their social impact, providing insights for entrepreneurs in other regions(Hota et al., 2023).

While the integration of ethical values and social responsibility in entrepreneurship offers significant benefits, it also presents challenges. Entrepreneurs must balance diverse stakeholder interests and navigate ethical dilemmas, which can be complex and context-specific. However, the successful models and practices emerging from regions like Guanajuato provide valuable lessons and frameworks that can be adapted and applied in other contexts, fostering a global movement towards more socially responsible and impactful entrepreneurship.

### 4. Entrepreneurial leadership in emerging sectors

**Research question:**
How can leadership and entrepreneurship education prepare students to play key roles in emerging sectors such as technology, renewable energy or biotechnology, and what factors promote the creation of innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems in strategic sectors in regions such as Guanajuato?

Leadership and entrepreneurship education are pivotal in preparing students to excel in emerging sectors such as technology, renewable energy, and biotechnology. These educational frameworks not only equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge but also foster innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems, particularly in strategic regions like Guanajuato. The integration of entrepreneurial education with leadership development can significantly enhance students' capabilities to contribute to and lead in these dynamic fields.

## Entrepreneurial Education and Sustainable Communities

- Entrepreneurial education plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and societal needs, fostering sustainable communities. Key components include partnerships, incubators, and student entrepreneurship clubs, which are essential for developing socially conscious entrepreneurs and generating long-term job prospects(Suguna et al., 2024).
- Alumni networks and curriculum designs are identified as motivators that can drive the creation of strategic initiatives and policies, thereby supporting the development of innovation ecosystems(Suguna et al., 2024).

## The Role of Entrepreneurial Universities

- Entrepreneurial universities are central to developing large-scale research infrastructure and fostering collaboration between academia and industry. These institutions must engage robustly with external actors to apply research practically, thereby catalyzing regional and national economic development(Rådberg & Löfsten, 2023).

### 6. Collaboration between education, industry and society

**Research question:**
How can universities and educational centers collaborate more effectively with industry and society to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, and what models of collaboration between educational institutions, companies and governments are most effective in supporting purposeful innovation?

Universities and educational centers can enhance their collaboration with industry and society to foster innovation and entrepreneurship by adopting strategic models that integrate academic, industrial, and governmental efforts. Effective collaboration models, such as the Triple Helix and various university-industry cooperation frameworks, have been identified as instrumental in supporting purposeful innovation. These models emphasize the importance of aligning interests, sharing resources, and leveraging intellectual capital to drive economic growth and technological advancement.

## University-Industry Collaboration Models

- **Triple Helix Model**: This model involves the interaction between universities, industries, and governments to promote technology transfer and sustainable development. It emphasizes the establishment of intermediary organizations like technology transfer offices and incubators to facilitate knowledge exchange and innovation(Hailu, 2024). The model has been successfully implemented in various contexts, including Ethiopia, where it aims to address industry challenges through enhanced collaboration(Hailu, 2024).
    
- **Research and Development Partnerships**: These partnerships are crucial for MSMEs and universities to boost their innovation pipelines. They involve joint research initiatives that leverage the strengths of both academia and industry to develop new technologies and processes(Tereshchenko et al., 2024).
    
- **Internships and Co-op Programs**: These programs provide students with practical experience and exposure to industry practices, enhancing their employability and entrepreneurial skills. They also allow industries to benefit from fresh perspectives and innovative ideas(Tereshchenko et al., 2024).
    
- **Knowledge Transfer Programs**: These initiatives facilitate the exchange of knowledge and expertise between universities and industries, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation(Tereshchenko et al., 2024).
    

## Facilitators and Barriers to Collaboration

- **Facilitators**: Successful university-industry collaborations are often driven by mutual benefits, such as access to advanced research, improved competitive edge, and enhanced innovation outcomes. Universities play a moderating role in amplifying the impact of innovation spending on results, making them crucial partners for businesses seeking to innovate(Alberto, 2024). Additionally, the integration of intellectual capital, including human, relational, and structural capital, is essential for enhancing corporate performance through academic engagement and commercialization(Yin et al., 2023).
    
- **Barriers**: Common barriers include a lack of funding, insufficient qualified personnel, and inadequate alignment between academic curricula and market demands. These challenges can hinder the development of effective collaboration models and the adoption of innovative technologies(Jakubakynov et al., 2024). Moreover, perceived costs of collaboration often outweigh the benefits, necessitating efficient support systems and extrinsic rewards to encourage academic participation(Marques et al., 2024).
    

## Government and Policy Support

- **Government-Industry-University-Research (GIUR) Collaboration**: This approach involves a tripartite evolutionary game model that coordinates the interests of various stakeholders to cultivate aligned talent and address mismatches between education and societal needs. It suggests reducing cooperation costs, balancing benefit distribution, and implementing reward mechanisms to enhance collaboration(Ma & Yang, 2024).
    
- **Policy Initiatives**: Governments can play a pivotal role by providing financial support, facilitating partnerships, and promoting innovation through policies that encourage academia-industry linkages. For instance, the National Agricultural Higher Education Project in India aims to improve agricultural education through effective collaborations, benefiting both students and industries(Soam et al., 2023).
    

While these models and strategies provide a robust framework for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, challenges remain in aligning the diverse interests of academia, industry, and government. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to institutionalize collaboration, adapt to technological advancements, and ensure that educational curricula meet the evolving needs of the market and society.

### 8. Inclusive entrepreneurship education

**Research question:**
How can innovation and entrepreneurship education programmes be designed that are accessible to students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and what educational policies can ensure that the benefits of a culture of innovation reach all sectors of society, including rural and marginalized communities?

Designing innovation and entrepreneurship education programs that are accessible to students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds requires a multifaceted approach. This involves integrating technology, fostering inclusive educational policies, and creating supportive environments that encourage participation from all sectors of society, including rural and marginalized communities. The following sections outline key strategies and educational policies that can help achieve these goals.

## Integration of Technology and Innovative Teaching Methods

- **AI and Big Data Utilization**: The integration of artificial intelligence and big data can enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship education. For instance, the use of AI-generated content (AIGC) and big data-driven algorithms can personalize learning experiences and improve resource allocation, making education more inclusive and efficient(Wang, 2024) (Li et al., 2024).
- **Online and Hybrid Learning Models**: Developing online teaching systems and information management systems can provide flexible learning opportunities for students from various backgrounds. These systems can be optimized using algorithms to ensure efficient resource allocation and improve student engagement and performance(Liu et al., 2024).

## Curriculum Design and Pedagogical Approaches

- **Interdisciplinary and Applied Learning**: Incorporating interdisciplinary approaches and applied learning into curricula can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This approach is particularly effective in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship skills among students in applied undergraduate programs(Wu, 2024).
- **Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SIE) Education**: SIE education can be a powerful tool for engaging students in sustainable development and social impact initiatives. By analyzing curricula and teaching methods, educators can design impactful SIE learning experiences that resonate with students from diverse backgrounds(Wang & Horta, 2024).

## Educational Policies and Institutional Support

- **School-Enterprise Partnerships**: Establishing collaborative platforms between schools and enterprises can provide students with real-world experience and enhance their entrepreneurial skills. This model encourages the development of sustainable innovation teams and supports the integration of industry knowledge into educational programs(Kong et al., 2024).
- **Supportive Frameworks and Resource Allocation**: Educational policies should focus on creating supportive frameworks that enhance resource efficiency and align educational resources with specific tasks. This includes fostering school-business partnerships and ensuring that educational institutions have the necessary resources to support innovation and entrepreneurship education(Wu, 2024).

## Addressing Socioeconomic Barriers

- **Inclusive Educational Models**: Models like the "Four-Drive-One-Guide" in vocational colleges emphasize the integration of industry teaching and curriculum optimization to enhance students' innovative and entrepreneurial thinking. These models are particularly effective in regions with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds(Rong, 2024).
- **Cultural and Gender Considerations**: Addressing cultural and gender disparities in entrepreneurship education is crucial. Studies highlight the need for a supportive entrepreneurial culture and adequate faculty strength to overcome these barriers(Xu, 2023).

While these strategies and policies can significantly enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship education, it is essential to consider the unique challenges faced by rural and marginalized communities. Tailoring programs to meet the specific needs of these communities, such as through localized content and community engagement initiatives, can further ensure that the benefits of a culture of innovation reach all sectors of society. Additionally, fostering environmental awareness and sustainability in entrepreneurship education can align with broader social and environmental goals, although its direct influence on entrepreneurial intention may vary across cultural contexts(Paiva et al., 2024).

### 9. Measuring the impact of educational innovation

**Research question:**
What indicators are most effective for measuring the impact of innovation and entrepreneurship programmes on the long-term success of students and on the economic and social development of the region, and how can the results of entrepreneurial education be assessed in terms of their contribution to sustainable development and the creation of social value?

The effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship programs can be measured through a variety of indicators that assess both the long-term success of students and the broader economic and social development of the region. These indicators include personal characteristics, socio-emotional skills, sustainability metrics, and innovation capacity. Additionally, the contribution of entrepreneurial education to sustainable development and social value creation can be evaluated through specific frameworks and methodologies.

## Key Indicators for Measuring Impact

- **Personal Characteristics and Socio-Economic Context**: The success of entrepreneurship is significantly influenced by personal characteristics such as income, age, gender, and skills, as well as the interaction between opportunity and education. These factors can guide social policies aimed at economic development(Rubilar-Torrealba et al., 2022).
    
- **Socio-Emotional Skills**: Programs that enhance socio-emotional skills, such as resilience and empathy, are more effective in improving entrepreneurship outcomes than those focusing solely on technical skills. These skills help students regulate emotions and make rational decisions, which are crucial for entrepreneurial success(Egana-delSol et al., 2023).
    
- **Sustainability Indicators**: A comprehensive set of sustainability indicators can measure the social impact of university-community engagement programs. These indicators are categorized into social challenges, economic growth, and sustainable living, aligning with sustainable development goals(Compan et al., 2024).
    
- **Innovation Capacity**: The balanced scorecard is an effective tool for measuring business efficiency and innovation performance. It helps assess the impact of innovation activities within enterprises and guides decision-making for innovation-related policies(Sarsen et al., 2023).
    

## Assessing Entrepreneurial Education's Contribution

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship courses can be assessed using data analysis technologies, such as neural networks, which evaluate student satisfaction and course approval. This approach provides a quantitative measure of educational outcomes(Zhu, 2023).
    
- **Monitoring and Evaluation Systems**: The Markov model and multiple regression analysis can be used to monitor and evaluate the growth of students' innovation and entrepreneurship abilities. Key factors influencing these abilities include curriculum teaching, campus atmosphere, and research conditions(Cao et al., 2024).
    
- **Impact Measurement through RCTs**: Repeated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can measure the impact of entrepreneurship training programs. Adjustments in program content, such as balancing leadership and traditional entrepreneurial skills training, can lead to significant improvements in entrepreneurial activities(Astebro & Hoos, 2021).
    

## Broader Perspectives on Innovation and Entrepreneurship

The role of entrepreneurial universities in regional socioeconomic development is significant. Alumni from these institutions often take on leadership roles in innovation policymaking, promoting startup-centric innovation policies. This long-term impact highlights the importance of integrating entrepreneurship education with regional development strategies(Klingler-Vidra & Chalmers, 2023). Additionally, a multidimensional approach to measuring territorial innovation efforts, such as the UW-TOPSIS method, can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different regions, guiding policy decisions for socioeconomic improvement(Tania et al., 2022).

In conclusion, the effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship programs can be measured through a combination of personal, socio-emotional, and sustainability indicators. These programs contribute to sustainable development and social value creation by enhancing students' skills and influencing regional policies. However, the complexity of measuring these impacts requires a multidimensional approach that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors.

### 10. Transforming ideas into scalable companies

**Research question:**
What educational and business incubation strategies are most effective in helping young entrepreneurs transform innovative ideas into scalable and sustainable companies, and how can educational institutions in Guanajuato develop ecosystems that facilitate the transition of academic projects to successful startups with global impact?

To effectively transform innovative ideas into scalable and sustainable companies, educational and business incubation strategies must be tailored to support young entrepreneurs. This involves leveraging digital tools, fostering strategic alliances, and providing targeted resources. Educational institutions in Guanajuato can develop ecosystems that facilitate the transition of academic projects to successful startups with global impact by implementing these strategies.

## Digital Tools and Technologies

- **SMAC Technologies**: Social, mobile, analytics, and cloud (SMAC) technologies are crucial in enhancing the incubation processes within university incubators. These tools facilitate interactions among incubators and various actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, aiding in the search and selection of incubatees, business support, and networking. However, they are currently underutilized and present an opportunity for incubator managers to further develop innovative ideas and foster entrepreneurial ecosystems(Chan et al., 2022).

## Strategic Alliances and Co-opetition

- **Co-opetition Strategy**: A balance between cooperation and competition, known as co-opetition, significantly improves incubator performance. This strategy allows incubators to enhance value creation and performance by strategically interacting within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Policymakers are encouraged to favor hybrid strategies like co-opetition over pure strategies to optimize incubator performance(Theodoraki et al., 2020).
- **Bridging Role of Incubators**: Incubators play a critical role in facilitating alliances between startups and third parties, which is essential for their growth and success. The effectiveness of this bridging role depends on the institutional affiliation of the incubator and the type of alliance, rather than the size of the incubator(Grilli & Marzano, 2023).

## Tailored Support for Different Industries

- **Technology vs. Creative Industries**: Entrepreneurs in technology-based industries benefit from resources like physical capital for proof of concept, financial grants, and technical knowledge. In contrast, those in creative industries require support for product development, smaller-scale financing, and business basics knowledge. Understanding these differences is crucial for providing effective incubation support(Nicholls-Nixon et al., 2022).

## Globalization and Internationalization

- **Born Global Startups**: Incubators support the internationalization process of startups by providing resources and mechanisms such as networking, mentoring, and credibility. These factors are crucial for startups aiming to enter international markets and can be leveraged to stimulate the emergence of born global startups, thus fostering economic growth(Pinto & Rua, 2023).

## Sustainable Development and Innovation

- **Sustainability-Driven Incubation**: Business incubators are increasingly expected to nurture sustainability-driven startups. A diverse support service portfolio is necessary to address specific sustainability challenges and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tailoring BI programs to meet these diverse needs is essential for achieving sustainable impacts(Karahan et al., 2022).

## Educational Ecosystems in Guanajuato

To develop ecosystems that facilitate the transition of academic projects to successful startups with global impact, educational institutions in Guanajuato should:

- **Implement Digital Tools**: Utilize SMAC technologies to enhance incubation processes and foster innovation.
- **Adopt Co-opetition Strategies**: Encourage a balance of cooperation and competition to improve incubator performance.
- **Provide Tailored Support**: Offer industry-specific resources and support to meet the unique needs of technology and creative industry entrepreneurs.
- **Facilitate Globalization**: Support the internationalization of startups through networking and credibility-building initiatives.
- **Focus on Sustainability**: Develop incubation programs that address specific sustainability challenges and contribute to the SDGs.

While these strategies are promising, it is important to recognize the challenges and limitations associated with incubation processes. For instance, the effectiveness of incubators can vary based on regional and institutional contexts, and not all incubators may have the resources to implement these strategies effectively. Additionally, the balance between personalization and large-scale development remains a challenge in entrepreneurship education(Liu, 2023).
