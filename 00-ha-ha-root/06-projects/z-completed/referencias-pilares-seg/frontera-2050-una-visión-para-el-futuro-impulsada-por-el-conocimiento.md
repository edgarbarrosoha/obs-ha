### 1. Impact of research on regional development

**Research question:**
How can investment in research and development transform Guanajuato into an engine of innovation and economic growth for Mexico, and what factors are key for the region to become a center of scientific and technological excellence?

Investment in research and development (R&D) can significantly transform Guanajuato into a hub of innovation and economic growth for Mexico. This transformation hinges on several key factors, including the strategic alignment of university research, the balance of basic and applied research, cultural and regional considerations, and the integration of transformative innovation policies. By addressing these elements, Guanajuato can position itself as a center of scientific and technological excellence.

## Strategic University Research Alignment

- Universities play a crucial role in regional development by attracting R&D investments from firms. The orientation of university research towards either basic or applied sciences significantly influences the type of R&D investment attracted. Universities with high-quality applied research tend to attract development-focused R&D investments, while those excelling in basic research draw research-oriented investments(Belderbos et al., 2024).
- The transformation of scientific and technological achievements from universities into economic growth is more effective in regions with concentrated university resources and developed economies. Guanajuato can enhance its transformation efficiency by fostering strong university-industry collaborations(Chen, 2023).

## Balancing Basic and Applied Research

- The proportion of basic research investment in R&D expenditure has a significant impact on regional economic growth efficiency. An optimal balance, avoiding the extremes of the "inverted U-shaped" impact path, is crucial for maximizing growth efficiency(Jiang et al., 2022).
- The Swedish paradox, where high R&D investment does not necessarily lead to high economic growth, highlights the importance of strategic R&D allocation. Guanajuato must carefully manage its R&D investments to avoid diminishing returns and ensure sustainable economic growth(Yu et al., 2021).

## Cultural and Regional Considerations

- Cultural factors significantly influence R&D intensity and its effectiveness as a competitive advantage. Understanding and integrating local cultural dynamics can enhance the impact of R&D investments(Lorca & Andrés, 2019).
- Regional collaboration models, such as FONTAGRO in the agrifood sector, demonstrate the potential of combining public and private efforts to support science, technology, and innovation. Such models can be adapted to Guanajuato's context to address specific regional challenges and opportunities(Saini, 2023).

## Transformative Innovation Policies

- Universities in Latin America, including those in Guanajuato, can play a pivotal role in implementing transformative innovation policies. These policies should focus on sustainable development, social inclusion, and addressing socio-economic and environmental issues. Engaging various stakeholders, including researchers, students, and civil society, is essential for successful policy implementation(Villa-Enciso et al., 2023).
- The National Science Foundation's initiative to fund "innovation engines" underscores the importance of turning research into regional prosperity. Guanajuato can leverage similar strategies to spur economic growth through innovation(Mervis, 2024).

While the potential for R&D to drive economic growth in Guanajuato is significant, it is important to recognize the challenges and limitations. Historical environmental issues, such as mercury contamination from past industrial activities, pose ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure sustainable development(Loria et al., 2022). Additionally, the need for a balanced approach to R&D investment, avoiding the pitfalls of the Swedish paradox, is crucial for long-term success. By strategically addressing these factors, Guanajuato can become a leading center of innovation and economic growth in Mexico.

### 5. Investment in R&D and its social and economic return

**Research question:**
How can the social and economic impact of investment in research and development in Guanajuato be measured, and what productive sectors in Mexico can benefit most from this investment to boost their global competitiveness?

Investing in research and development (R&D) in Guanajuato, Mexico, can have significant social and economic impacts, which can be measured using various frameworks and methodologies. Additionally, identifying productive sectors that can benefit from such investments is crucial for enhancing global competitiveness. This response explores the measurement of R&D impacts and highlights sectors in Mexico that stand to gain the most from these investments.

## Measuring Social and Economic Impact

- **Translational Research Metrics**: Traditional metrics for assessing the impact of R&D often focus on commercial success, but broader societal impacts are increasingly prioritized. Metrics should encompass societal benefits, such as health improvements and environmental sustainability, to provide a comprehensive view of R&D outcomes(Duda et al., 2023).
    
- **ASIRPA Framework and Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM)**: These mixed-method evaluation approaches are used to assess the societal impact of R&D, particularly in the agri-food sector. They consider economic, socio-territorial, health, political, capacity building, and environmental impacts, providing a standardized index for comprehensive impact measurement(Chams et al., 2020).
    
- **Quantitative Frameworks for Impact Investing**: A quantitative framework can assess the financial impact of R&D investments, considering factors like risk-adjusted returns and correlations with unobserved excess returns. This approach helps in understanding the financial rewards or costs associated with R&D investments compared to traditional benchmarks(Lo & Zhang, 2023).
    
- **Sustainability Assessment Tools**: Tools like the Sustainability Assessment Adaptive and Low-input Tool (SALT) are crucial for evaluating progress towards sustainable agriculture. These tools are tailored to local contexts, such as those in Mexico, and help in assessing the impact of R&D on sustainability goals(Calleros-Islas, 2019).
    

## Productive Sectors Benefiting from R&D Investment

- **Agri-Food Sector**: The agri-food sector in Mexico can significantly benefit from R&D investments aimed at transforming conventional agriculture into a sustainable industry. This sector's reliance on R&D for environmental management and sustainability makes it a prime candidate for investment(Chams et al., 2020) (Calleros-Islas, 2019).
    
- **Renewable Energy Sector**: The production of solar photovoltaic panels in Mexico presents a substantial opportunity for economic and environmental benefits. R&D in this sector can enhance production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, positioning Mexico as a competitive player in the global renewable energy market(López-Flores et al., 2023).
    
- **Livestock and Bioeconomy**: Investments in the livestock sector, particularly in eco-intensification, can improve environmental efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This sector's potential for significant returns on investment makes it a strategic area for R&D focus("Frontier model of the environmental inefficiency effects on livestock bioeconomy", 2023).
    
- **Waste Management and ESG Strategies**: Developing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies for waste disposal centers can enhance their efficiency and contribute to broader industrial development. R&D in this area can lead to improved waste management practices and social welfare benefits(Gholian-Jouybari et al., 2024).
    

## Broader Perspectives

While R&D investments can drive economic growth and sustainability, challenges remain in achieving a balance between economic development and environmental protection. For instance, while R&D can help decouple economic growth from carbon emissions, other factors like industrialization and urbanization also play significant roles(Wang & Zhang, 2020). Additionally, disparities in global government investments in education and R&D highlight the need for equitable resource allocation to maximize the benefits of R&D investments(Okoye et al., 2022). These considerations underscore the complexity of measuring and optimizing the impacts of R&D investments in Guanajuato and beyond.

### 8. Promoting a research culture in higher education

**Research question:**
What educational policies can be implemented to foster a research culture in higher education, preparing students to contribute to scientific and technological advancement, and how can universities promote a more inclusive and accessible research environment

To foster a research culture in higher education that prepares students for scientific and technological advancement, educational policies must focus on creating an inclusive and accessible research environment. This involves implementing strategies that promote research governance, intellectual property management, equity-centered policy frameworks, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Universities can play a pivotal role by adopting these policies to cultivate a robust research culture and ensure equitable participation in research activities.

## Research Governance and Capacity Building

- **Research Governance Tools**: Establishing clear research governance tools is essential for cultivating a research culture. This includes creating policies that reinforce desired research behaviors, support research dissemination, and promote collaboration and networking among researchers(Fussy, 2024).
- **Capacity Building**: Building research capacity through training programs and workshops can enhance the skills of both academic staff and students. This approach helps in developing critical thinkers and researchers who can contribute to socio-economic development(Fussy, 2024).

## Intellectual Property Management

- **IP Policies**: Universities should develop comprehensive intellectual property (IP) policies that balance the rights of students and staff with institutional interests. These policies should clearly define IP ownership and revenue-sharing arrangements to incentivize innovation and research commercialization(Jamali, 2024).
- **Student Involvement**: Special attention should be given to policies that address the rights of students, particularly those engaged in research activities, to ensure their contributions are recognized and rewarded(Jamali, 2024).

## Equity-Centered Policy Frameworks

- **Equity-Centered Implementation**: Implementing policies with an equity-centered approach can address barriers to educational equity. This involves considering factors such as identity consciousness, institutional complexity, and sociopolitical context to create more inclusive and transformative educational environments(Felix & Nienhusser, 2024) (Felix & Nienhusser, 2023).
- **Inclusive Policy Design**: Policies should be designed to be inclusive and accessible, ensuring that all students, regardless of background, have equal opportunities to participate in research activities(Felix & Nienhusser, 2024).

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Practices

- **DEI Frameworks**: Adopting standardized DEI frameworks can help institutions create a more inclusive research environment. These frameworks should be adaptable to different institutional contexts and focus on improving the academic environment for all researchers(Gonzalez et al., 2023).
- **Gender Equity Initiatives**: Implementing initiatives that promote gender equity in research, particularly in STEM fields, can help reduce inequalities and support sustainable education. These initiatives should be supported by public policies and institutional strategies(Bustamante-Mora et al., 2024).

## Promoting a Positive Research Culture

- **Organizational Policies**: Universities should focus on policies that enhance a positive research culture by aligning staff recognition with organizational missions and promoting openness, transparency, and inclusivity(Liston & Fitzgerald, 2024).
- **Research Retreats**: Organizing accessible and inclusive research retreats can provide valuable educational experiences and encourage participation from diverse student groups(Fuller et al., 2024).

While these strategies provide a comprehensive approach to fostering a research culture, it is important to recognize the challenges and limitations that may arise. For instance, structural constraints within institutions can hinder the effective implementation of these policies, and there may be resistance to change from established norms. Additionally, the effectiveness of these policies in different cultural and institutional contexts may vary, necessitating ongoing evaluation and adaptation to ensure they meet the needs of all stakeholders. By addressing these challenges, universities can create a more inclusive and dynamic research environment that prepares students for future scientific and technological contributions.

### 9. Knowledge and technology transfer to the productive sector

**Research question:**
What are the most effective mechanisms for the transfer of knowledge and technology from research centers to companies, and how can graduate programs and research centers in Guanajuato promote the creation of startups and technological spin-offs to contribute to economic development?

The transfer of knowledge and technology from research centers to companies is a multifaceted process that can significantly contribute to economic development, particularly through the creation of startups and technological spin-offs. Effective mechanisms for this transfer include the recognition of transfer opportunities, the choice of appropriate transfer channels, and the fostering of university-industry collaborations. In Guanajuato, graduate programs and research centers can play a pivotal role in promoting these activities to stimulate economic growth.

## Mechanisms for Knowledge and Technology Transfer

- **Opportunity Recognition and Transfer Channels**: The initiation of knowledge transfer begins with recognizing opportunities and selecting suitable channels. Scientists with diverse prior knowledge are more likely to identify transfer opportunities. Spin-offs are often chosen by those willing to take risks and engage in basic research, while intellectual property rights are preferred for applied research. Role models also positively influence these choices(Huegel et al., 2024).
    
- **Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms**: In franchise networks, high information-rich mechanisms such as training and video conferences are effective for transferring tacit knowledge, while IT-based methods like emails and intranets are better for explicit knowledge. This suggests that aligning the tacitness of knowledge with the richness of the transfer mechanism is crucial for performance(Gorovaia et al., 2023).
    
- **University-Industry Collaborations**: Collaborations between universities and industries, particularly through joint patents, significantly enhance the creation of spin-offs. The number of collaborations and the history of previous partnerships positively impact spin-off creation, indicating that sustained interactions foster innovation(Martínez-Ardila et al., 2023).
    

## Promoting Startups and Spin-offs in Guanajuato

- **Role of Graduate Programs and Research Centers**: Graduate programs can encourage entrepreneurship by integrating industry-relevant skills and fostering a culture of innovation. Research centers can facilitate spin-offs by providing access to resources and networks, and by engaging in collaborative projects with industries(Canonico et al., 2020).
    
- **Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)**: TTOs can prevent spin-off bankruptcy by building professional relationships, sharing market knowledge, and providing customer-oriented resources. Their involvement is crucial in maintaining the viability of spin-offs(Kirihata, 2024).
    
- **Cluster Development**: The example of Silicon Fen shows that strong technological bonds between universities and local firms, particularly spin-offs, can drive regional innovation. Guanajuato can emulate this by fostering clusters around its universities, encouraging senior academics to engage in spin-off creation(Rezaei & Kamali, 2022).
    

## Broader Perspectives

While the mechanisms discussed are effective, the context of Guanajuato may present unique challenges and opportunities. For instance, the local entrepreneurial framework conditions, such as government support and education, play a significant role in facilitating R&D transfer to new firms(Sá & Pinho, 2019). Additionally, the strategic direction of reverse technology transfers, as seen in firms like Huawei, can offer insights into leveraging external innovation capabilities to build domestic strengths(Schaefer et al., 2024). These broader perspectives highlight the importance of tailoring strategies to local conditions and leveraging global best practices to enhance the impact of knowledge and technology transfer on economic development.

### 10. The role of public policy in scientific development

**Research question:**
How can public policies in Mexico facilitate the growth of research and development, and what successful government initiatives in other countries could be adapted to the context of Guanajuato to promote the connection between the academic and productive sectors?

Public policies in Mexico can play a pivotal role in fostering research and development (R&D) by creating an environment that encourages innovation and collaboration between the academic and productive sectors. By examining successful government initiatives from other countries, Mexico, particularly the state of Guanajuato, can adapt these strategies to enhance its own innovation ecosystem. The following sections explore how public policies can facilitate R&D growth and highlight international initiatives that could be adapted to Guanajuato's context.

## Transforming Innovation Systems into Ecosystems

- Public policies should aim to transform traditional innovation systems into dynamic innovation ecosystems. This involves fostering cross-boundary interactions on a global scale, promoting an institutionalized civil society, and embedding sustainability in economic, social, and environmental dimensions(Zheng & Cai, 2022).
- The neo-Triple Helix model suggests that policies should encourage collaboration among universities, industries, and governments to create a conducive environment for innovation(Zheng & Cai, 2022).

## Role of Eco-Innovation Policies

- Eco-innovation policies are crucial as they link innovation with environmental sustainability. Governments can use policy tools such as R&D investments, regulations, and incentives to promote eco-innovation, which is essential for sustainable economic growth(Naruetharadhol et al., 2024).
- These policies can particularly benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are vital for environmental sustainability and economic development(Naruetharadhol et al., 2024).

## University-Industry Collaboration

- Policies that strengthen the university-industry R&D nexus are essential. The Triple Helix model emphasizes the importance of public policies in facilitating collaborations that enhance the production of basic science and its application in industry(Faria et al., 2019).
- Research cluster policies, like those implemented in France, have shown that funding local research communities can significantly increase collaborations and innovation outputs(Carayol et al., 2023).

## Lessons from International Mobility Policies

- International mobility policies, such as Mexico’s Scholarship Program in nanotechnology, have been effective in building high-quality research skills. However, their impact on domestic research capacity is limited, suggesting a need for policies that also strengthen local research infrastructure(Tirado, 2023).

## Successful International Initiatives

- France’s research cluster policy, which funds local research communities, has successfully increased collaboration among researchers, suggesting a model that could be adapted to Guanajuato to enhance academic-industry partnerships(Carayol et al., 2023).
- Mexico’s experience with public health policies, such as the soda tax, demonstrates the potential of fiscal and regulatory tools to drive innovation and public health improvements, which could be adapted to promote R&D in other sectors(Pedroza-Tobías et al., 2021).

While these strategies offer promising pathways for enhancing R&D in Mexico, it is important to consider the unique socio-economic and cultural context of Guanajuato. Policies must be tailored to local needs and capacities, ensuring that they are inclusive and equitable. Additionally, the potential resistance from established industries, as seen in the case of the soda tax, highlights the need for robust stakeholder engagement and conflict-of-interest-free research to support policy implementation(Pedroza-Tobías et al., 2021). By learning from international experiences and adapting them to local contexts, Mexico can create a thriving innovation ecosystem that bridges the gap between academia and industry.
