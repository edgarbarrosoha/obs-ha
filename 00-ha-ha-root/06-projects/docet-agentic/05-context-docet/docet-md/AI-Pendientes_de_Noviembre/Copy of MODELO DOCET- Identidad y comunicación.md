Students read complex rhythms and interpret two-voice polyphonic textures (intervals up to the 7th). They learn to compose short pieces using ternary and sectional forms, and analyze texture and form. They are introduced to basic recording techniques (mic positioning, multi-track).
Middle school 7
Improvisation & Electric Instruments
Students explore rhythmic and melodic improvisation and read irregular meters (5/4, 7/8). They begin practicing on electric instruments (guitar, bass, drums) and apply basic audio production techniques (EQ, volume balancing) to original projects. They start harmonizing with basic chords and inversions.
Middle school 8
Modal Scales & Advanced Harmony
Students identify, perform, and analyze modal scales (Dorian, Mixolydian) and extended harmony (major 7th, dominant 7th chords). They read and perform with multiple and changing time signatures. They apply advanced recording techniques (compression, audio effects) and analyze music based on mode and emotional expression.
Middle school 9
Complex Composition & Professional Production
Students read and interpret polyrhythms and complex ensemble scores. They compose and arrange original pieces using advanced harmonic contexts and contemporary techniques. They demonstrate high-level coordination in performance and apply advanced audio production skills (mastering, mixing) to produce complete, professional-quality musical projects.

Elementary 1
Foundational Dance
The student coordinates the body using basic spatial concepts, executes and performs basic movements inspired by different dance techniques.Interprets primary emotions through movement, and creates a simple 24-step choreography while understanding basic theater context and parts.
Elementary 2
Intermediate dance
The student recognizes corporal laterality and dances to the rhythm, executes intermediate movement based on different dance techniques. Performs a combined piece, interpreting secondary emotions through body movements, creating a simple 48-step choreography. Recognizes basic theater lighting concepts.
Elementary 3
Advanced movement
The student differentiates movement intentions (flowy, strong) with body percussion, executes intermediate dance movements based on different dance techniques. Interprets a full spectrum of emotions in choreography, and creates a dance/theatrical moment through teamwork, demonstrating advanced spatial awareness.
Elementary 4
Foundational theater
The student creates characters using physical, vocal, and intellectual exploration. Understands theater origins, executing basic performance techniques. Creates characters and original theatrical performances.
Elementary 5
Theater
The student deepens character work using animal exploration; applies object theater, puppeteering, and improv; works with storyboards; performs Commedia dell'Arte archetypes; and demonstrates advanced dramaturgy and storytelling by creating an original tent theater (
teatro de carpa
) play.

Graduate Profile
Nursery
The student uses art as a medium for 
sensory expression
, representing ideas with materials like paint and clay. They combine colors, explore techniques from different artists, and use art resources to bring characters to life in symbolic play.
Pre K
The student consolidates the use of visual arts to 
represent real or imaginary stories and characters
. They use various modeling, drawing, and painting techniques and continue to explore color mixing for their creations.
Kinder
The student begins to work with more 
formal artistic concepts
, identifying and painting with warm and cool colors, and geometric shapes. They create patterns based on characteristics like size and color and show interest in artistic creation using English vocabulary. They learn about different artists and famous art pieces.
Lower Elementary
The student acquires and applies 
fundamental plastic arts techniques
 such as pointillism, watercolor, drawing to scale, and relief sculpture. They learn about art history movements like Impressionism and begin to explore artistic creation in a digital format.
Upper elementary
The student explores more 
abstract and advanced concepts
, such as cyanotype and photographic principles. They are introduced to moving images with the zoetrope and film. They use a variety of techniques and materials for their creations and edit digital photographs.
Middle school
The student becomes an 
integral visual creator
. They conceptualize, direct, and produce large-scale visual projects like documentaries or murals. They show proficiency in design, composition, and cinematic language, applying contemporary and digital art techniques to their projects.

Nursery
Sensory & Symbolic Expression
Students use visual art resources and combine colors for expression. They engage in symbolic play and dramatics (mimicry, costumes) to represent real or imaginary characters and create art inspired by diverse artists.
Pre K
Representation & Initial Techniques
Students continue sensory expression through modeling, drawing, and painting to represent ideas. They develop the ability to represent stories and characters using visual resources and engage in art-making inspired by national and international artists.
Kinder 1
Color Theory & Experimentation
Students learn primary and secondary colors, geometric shapes, and symmetry basics. They experiment with textures and use different media (clay, paint), demonstrating fine motor control and personal expression through simple techniques like pointillism and dripping.
Kinder 2
Line, Contrast & Vocabulary
Students learn about different types of lines, contrast, and complementary colors. They apply various artistic techniques to paint geometric shapes and create compositions. They begin to use art materials names in English and spontaneously reproduce details from studied artworks.
Kinder 3
Warm/Cool Colors & Patterns
Students understand the use of warm and cool colors and the difference between plane and solid geometric figures. They create patterns based on multiple characteristics (size, color, texture) and show interest in art while exploring different techniques inspired by diverse national and international artists.

Elementary 1
Line, Shadow & Art history
Students apply 
line, light, and shadow
 to create depth in drawings and apply color theory for gradients. They apply Pointillism, charcoal, and Impressionist techniques, and create sculptures/collages inspired by 
Stone Age and Ancient Egyptian art
, connecting technique to historical context.
Elementary 2
Composition & World Cultures
Students create compositions using 
contrast and gradients
 and apply advanced techniques like China ink for fabric studies and foundational ceramic skills. They study 
Ancient Greek, Roman, and Olmec/Mayan cultures
, creating works that reflect historical context, including mosaics and 
Cubist/Surrealist
 self-portraits/collages.
Elementary 3
Global Art & Expressive Form
Students explore 
color theory
 (tertiary colors), light, shadow, and geometry. They study
