### Detailed Session Suggestions

#### **1. Welcome & Introduction (09:00 – 09:15)**

- **Dynamic Introduction:**  
    Instead of a standard welcome, invite participants to share one word that describes their expectation for the workshop. Use a digital word cloud to visualize responses instantly, reinforcing the diversity of perspectives and highlighting the strategic challenges in the postal sector.
#### **2. AI Fundamentals in Context (09:15 – 09:45)**

- **Interactive Polling:**  
    Use live polls to ask, “Which AI paradigm do you see as most promising for postal operations?” and display results in real time. This scientifically supports the principle of active learning and primes discussion on how each paradigm may address operational versus strategic challenges.
    
- **Real-World Examples:**  
    Briefly present case studies (e.g., routing optimization algorithms or anomaly detection in package sorting) with interactive Q&A moments that encourage participants to connect these examples to their own experiences.
#### **3. Generative AI & LLMs: Concepts and Implications (09:45 – 10:15)**

- **Live Demonstration:**  
    Introduce a live demo of a generative AI model. Invite participants to observe how the model handles dynamic query processing. Ask for volunteers to input sample data (related to postal operations) and predict outcomes. This aligns with the “learning by doing” approach.
    
- **Scenario Simulation:**  
    Present a brief scenario (e.g., forecasting customer inquiries during peak seasons) and invite participants to reflect on how AI could simulate such scenarios. This establishes a link between theoretical capabilities and strategic applications.
#### **4. Coffee Break (10:15 – 10:30)**

- **Networking Prompt:**  
    Encourage participants to discuss among themselves one insight they’ve gained so far, fostering peer-to-peer learning even during breaks.
#### **5. Use Cases and Applications in the Postal Sector (10:30 – 11:00)**

- **Case Study Presentation:**  
    Showcase specific applications like DeepSeek, Claude, and OpenAI models. Use visual aids (graphs, short videos) to illustrate improvements in tracking, route planning, and customer service.
- **Interactive Q&A:**  
    Facilitate a quick round of questions to pinpoint which case studies resonate most with the participants’ challenges.
#### **6. Individual Hands-on Experience: Interactive Model Exploration (11:00 – 11:30)**

- **Guided Exploration:**  
    Each participant works individually on a tablet or laptop with a live AI interface. Provide a set of predefined challenges (for example, modifying parameters to see how output changes) that relate directly to postal data analysis.
- **Reflection Pause:**  
    Ask participants to note one surprising outcome or insight they discovered during the exercise. This technique, rooted in reflective practice, deepens individual learning.
#### **7. Collaborative Hands-on Group Exercise: Postal Strategy & Complexity (11:30 – 12:30)**

- **Structured Group Dynamics:**  
    Organize participants into small, diverse groups (ideally 4–6 members each). Use the **Jigsaw Technique** where each group first focuses on a specific facet (e.g., operational efficiency, customer interaction, strategic planning, and complexity management) and then reassembles to share findings.
- **Role-Playing Simulation:**  
    Assign each group a hypothetical scenario that involves a complex postal challenge. For example, one group might work on designing an AI-driven solution for managing unexpected surges in package volume, while another tackles strategic decisions for long-term route optimization.
- **Facilitated Collaboration:**  
    As the facilitator, move among groups, prompting them with questions such as “How can AI simplify this complex problem?” or “What strategic insights can you draw from the simulation?” Encourage them to use the live model from the earlier session to test their ideas in real time.
- **Creative Output:**  
    Have each group produce a visual mind map or diagram summarizing their proposed solution, which they will later share with the entire workshop. This not only reinforces the content but also leverages visual learning—a science-backed technique for memory retention.
#### **8. Q&A and Wrap-Up (Morning Session) (12:30 – 13:00)**

- **Reflection Round:**  
    Open the floor for participants to share key insights from the morning sessions. Use a “popcorn” style Q&A to keep the session dynamic and engaging.
---
#### **Lunch Break (13:00 – 14:00)**

- **Informal Networking:**  
    Arrange seating to encourage cross-disciplinary conversations. Consider a “table topic” card with discussion prompts related to AI and postal challenges.
---
#### **9. Recap and Introduction to Afternoon Topics (14:00 – 14:15)**

- **Digital Recap:**  
    Use a quick interactive quiz (e.g., via Kahoot) that recaps key morning insights. This reinforces learning through retrieval practice—a well-established science-based technique.
#### **10. Expanding the AI Landscape: Additional Approaches (14:15 – 15:00)**

- **Visual Case Comparisons:**  
    Present comparative visuals of Symbolic AI and Computer Vision in operational contexts versus strategic contexts. For example, display a side-by-side flowchart of how each approach can address package tracking and system complexity.
- **Interactive Discussion:**  
    Facilitate a brief roundtable discussion on how alternative AI methods can support and extend the applications of generative AI in the postal domain.
#### **11. Additional Group Discussion and Strategy Session (15:00 – 15:45)**

- **Open Space Technology:**  
    Adopt elements of the “Open Space Technology” model, allowing participants to propose topics for deeper discussion in an open, self-organized format.
- **Strategic Roadmapping:**  
    In their groups, ask participants to outline actionable next steps or a strategic roadmap for integrating AI in their organizations. Encourage each group to identify at least one “quick win” and one long-term goal.
- **Peer-to-Peer Feedback:**  
    Facilitate a round where groups share their roadmaps and receive structured feedback from peers, using a “plus/delta” framework (what worked well and what could be improved).
#### **12. Final Q&A and Closing Remarks (15:45 – 16:00)**

- **Synthesis Discussion:**  
    End with an open discussion, inviting final thoughts and reflective questions.
