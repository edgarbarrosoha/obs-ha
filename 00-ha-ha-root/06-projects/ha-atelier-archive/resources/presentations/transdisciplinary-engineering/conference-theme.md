**Transdisciplinarity for a better world**

Since 1994 our [ISTE](https://intsoctransde.org/) community has convened annually to discuss engineering for today’s most pressing social and technical challenges. The next TE conference will be held in the summer of 2025 on the EGADE Business School, of Tecnologico de Monterrey, in Monterrey, Mexico.

   The world is changing rapidly. The connectedness of the world’s most critical systems along with rapid advancement of methods push us to ask “How will we teach, research, and practice to engineer a better world?” The recent decade has shown an ongoing shift towards model-based design, instrumented products and teams, data-driven analytics, rapid prototyping, and continuous delivery. These changes are enabled on digital and physical platforms driven by distributed teams and open interfaces. Transformations are underway in several industrial sectors, including energy, agriculture, health, education, government, civil organizations, transportation among others always with a sustanable vision. It is an exciting time to be an transdisciplinar world changer!. 

We recognize the insufficiency of simple boundary crossing amongst traditional disciplines, as transdisciplinar professionals move beyond disciplinary norms established in the mid to late 20th century. Today we address systems in their context across a life-cycle, collaborate with a myriad of stakeholders and engineering and non-engineering academics and practitioner experts. 

With this framework in mind, TE2025 summon all transdisciplinar academic and non academic professionals that seek a better world by solving real complex problems, by taking into account stakeholders, using quantitative along with non quantitative disciplines, involving practitioners and academic point of views to join us in this conference. 

The conference will be organized across three tracks: 

1. Research 
2. Education
3. Practice
