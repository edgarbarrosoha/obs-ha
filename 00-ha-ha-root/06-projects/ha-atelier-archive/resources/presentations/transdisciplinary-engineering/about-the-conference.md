Theme: transdisciplinarity for a better world

**Welcome**

---

Since 1994, our ISTE community has convened annually to discuss engineering for today's most pressing social and technical challenges. The next TE conference will be held at EGADE Business School, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, México, from July 7-11, 2025.

TE2025 will bring together academic people and interested industry professionals from around the world to exchange their knowledge and ideas connected to the conference theme "Transdisciplinarity for a better world". Technological advancement, as we are all experiencing, has changed how we live, work, learn and socialise, exposing individuals to an open, connected world. All industrial, business, and education sectors are challenged to develop products, processes, and systems to build a better future for ours and future generations. However, today's world is much more complex that technology alone cannot be the answer. Collaborative teams of people with the ability to see a holistic picture, equipped with knowledge and skills in various disciplines, are indispensable to effectively exploit the technologies in this changing and connected world.

The transdisciplinary approach deals with complex problems by identifying impacts and inputs from all stakeholders, including quantitative and qualitative disciplines, practitioners, and academics, to generate holistic, focused solutions implemented using management knowledge. 

TE2025 seeks to bring together academics, practitioners, students, and other stakeholders to share their views on using the transdisciplinary approach to engineer a better world.

Similar to previous TE conferences, our participants will be in contact with current research related to Transdisciplinary Engineering and will also experience active involvement in workshops, panel discussions, industrial visits and poster sessions. Furthermore, we are enthusiastic about having prominent keynote speakers share their visions to inspire and expand the horizon of our participants around our conference's main topics.
