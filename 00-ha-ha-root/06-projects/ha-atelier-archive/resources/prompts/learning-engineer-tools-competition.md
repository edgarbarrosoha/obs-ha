### Data Capture and Utilization in HA

HA prioritizes gathering learning data to both enhance the system and contribute to the field of learning science-engineering. The focus is on understanding how learning processes affect users' ability to achieve life goals, and linking these processes to tangible real-world outcomes.

### Key Data Points Include:

- **Engagement Data:** Tracks user activity, frequency of logins, and duration spent on tasks.
- **Performance Metrics:** Assesses skill levels, completion of tasks, and progress in learning paths.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Observes patterns in decision-making and reactions to AI feedback.
- **Cognitive Load and Adaptability:** Evaluates user interactions to gauge cognitive effort and adaptability.
- **Feedback and Self-Reflection:** Gathers user-provided content on self-assessment and goal setting.

### Core Research Questions:

- What is the correlation between engagement in complex adaptive system thinking with AI and learners' progress towards life goals? What is the impact of 21st-century skills?
- How effective are hybrid human-AI thinking frameworks in addressing 21st-century challenges and in developing skills for life readiness?
- What influence does AI have on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in diverse learning environments and age groups?
- How does HA contribute to bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to quality education for a technologically advanced future?
- What is the educators' perspective on the effectiveness of complexity science in aligning curricula with 21st-century learning standards?

### Collaborative Research Partnerships:

HA is growing its user base and collaborates with global researchers using anonymized data. Partnerships include:

- The Guanajuato Ministry of Education, Institute for the Future of Education at tec-monterrey, and experts like Dr. Adolfo de Unánue, MA Beatriz Huerta, Dr. Eusebio Vargas, and Dr. Héctor Ceballos. These collaborations focus on data science, AI, transdisciplinary methods, and evaluating HA's impact across learning environments.

### Collaboration Involves:

- Intellectual and technical efforts to enhance HA's learning engineering capabilities.
- Workshops for research, experiment design, and data alignment.
- Sharing anonymized HA data for research purposes.
- Commitment to analyze data for potential publications.

### Future Prospects and Data Access

With user base expansion, HA aims to launch an Open Data Science Framework. This will provide the broader research community with access protocols, qualification criteria, and guidelines for privacy and ethical use, benefiting the learning community at large.
