#### **Workshop Context and Key Definitions**

During the IIT Roorkee workshop on heuristics in frugal innovation, organizers emphasized that frugal innovation is not merely about creating cheap products. It is the development of products, services, and systems that are affordable and deliver essential value to underserved populations. This often involves creating low-cost solutions with **locally available and sustainable materials**, focusing on core functionality, cost-effectiveness, and a **reduction of complexity**.

These principles align with the concept of Frugal AI, which promotes cost-effective, sustainable AI systems designed for maximum efficiency and accessibility in resource-scarce environments. The "FRUGAL" acronym is often defined as **F**unctional, **R**obust, **U**ser-friendly, **G**rowing, **A**ffordable, and **L**ocal.

Heuristics—mental shortcuts or rules of thumb—are central to this process. The *Handbook on Frugal Innovation* defines heuristics as **strategies that ignore some information to make decisions faster, more frugally, and sometimes more accurately than complex methods**. They rely on limited cues and experience to allow for rapid adaptation. The effectiveness of a heuristic depends on its "ecological rationality"—how well it matches the environment in which it is used.

A key challenge identified at the workshop was the difficulty of **capturing heuristic data**. Traditional methods like self-reporting are often biased toward successful or memorable heuristics and fail to capture the tacit knowledge gained through interactions with materials, communities, and technologies. The central question became: how can we systematically collect data on heuristics, avoid bias, and develop adaptive methods that learn directly from practice?

#### **Horizons Architecture: An Overview**

Horizons Architecture (HA) is a theoretical framework designed to manage complex, adaptive endeavors by **structuring information and orchestrating human-AI collaboration across time and scale**. HA integrates three core components to address the challenges of frugal innovation research:

1.  **Fractal Dimensional Taxonomy:** A self-similar organizational structure built along a **Time axis** and a **Simultaneous Complexity axis**. It maps goals, stakeholders, knowledge, and resources across six core dimensions (Legacy, Community, Projects, Context, Technology, Learning). Because the structure is fractal, information can be organized consistently from the individual level to the global network level.
2.  **Generative Agentic Ontology (GAO):** A dynamic AI layer where specialized subagents are **generated, adapted, or retired** based on the system’s needs. Operating under explicit human oversight, these agents augment human capabilities by performing specific tasks within the fractal taxonomy, ensuring that their emergent behaviors remain aligned with strategic goals.
3.  **Non-Linear Temporal Coordination (NLTC):** A mechanism that links **past learning, present action, and future foresight**. It weaves historical data, real-time awareness, and scenario-based planning into a unified perspective, allowing the system to learn from previous decisions while anticipating future shifts.

By integrating these three elements, HA bridges short-term operations with long-term transformation. It treats AI agents as adaptive partners within a **fractal data infrastructure**, creating a rich, multiscale record that preserves not just outcomes but the crucial decision pathways and human-AI interactions that produced them.

#### **Why HA is Relevant to Heuristics Research in Frugal Innovation**

**1. Structuring Heuristics Across Scales and Dimensions**

Heuristics often emerge from tacit knowledge and local context. HA’s **fractal taxonomy** provides a systematic method to map each heuristic to its originating dimensions (e.g., which *Project* it serves, what *Context* triggered it) and its scale of application (individual, team, organization). This multi-scale mapping enables two powerful analytical views:

*   **Granular View:** Researchers can examine the detailed steps, cues, and interactions of a heuristic at a specific scale, preserving critical nuance.
*   **Bird’s-eye View:** Aggregated data reveals patterns across communities, highlighting which heuristics are generalizable and which are context-dependent.

This structured approach aligns with frugal innovation's "less-is-more" principle by helping researchers focus on the most relevant cues and information.

**2. Dynamic AI Agents for Capturing and Analyzing Heuristics**

The **Generative Agentic Ontology (GAO)** enables the creation of AI subagents designed specifically for data collection and analysis, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. These agents can be designed to:

*   **Capture Decision Sequences:** Unobtrusively record the steps, cues, and contextual factors in the innovation process through digital tools or sensors, reducing recall bias and capturing *unsuccessful* heuristics as well as successes.
*   **Classify Heuristics:** Automatically tag recorded decisions with taxonomic attributes (dimension, scale, time) to identify whether a decision follows a known heuristic or represents a novel one.
*   **Learn and Adapt:** Evolve based on new data and human feedback. If a heuristic consistently fails in a given context, its corresponding agent can be adapted or retired, ensuring the system remains efficient and relevant.
*   **Augment Human Judgment:** Suggest relevant heuristics or highlight overlooked environmental cues, while ensuring human users retain final interpretive oversight.

This system allows computational resources to be allocated frugally, and agents can be deployed as lightweight mobile tools, creating **Frugal AI** solutions.

**3. Temporal Coordination for Ecological Rationality**

Heuristics are highly context-dependent. HA’s **Non-Linear Temporal Coordination** ensures every heuristic is anchored in its proper temporal context. The mechanism systematically:

*   **Leverages Past Data:** GAO agents mine historical records of projects and community dynamics to identify patterns of when and where a heuristic previously succeeded or failed.
*   **Grounds Analysis in the Present:** Real-time monitoring of projects and environmental shifts provides the situational awareness needed to determine if a heuristic is still applicable.
*   **Informs Through Foresight:** Scenario planning and simulations help anticipate how emerging trends (e.g., climate change) might affect a heuristic's validity.

This continuous feedback loop embodies ecological rationality, allowing heuristics to be tested, validated, and transferred between contexts based on historical evidence.

**4. Building an Evidence-Based Repository for Collective Learning**

HA enables the creation of a **collective memory** of frugal innovation practices. By recording the complete *decision pathways*, the repository offers:

*   **Transparency and Accountability:** Researchers can trace how decisions were made and by whom, enabling more rigorous evaluation.
*   **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** The structured taxonomy allows heuristics from diverse fields (e.g., health, agriculture) to be compared and shared.
*   **Scalable Learning:** Lessons from grassroots innovations can be scaled to national or global levels without losing local context, and high-level insights can be localized.

#### **Synergies with Frugal Innovation and Frugal AI**

HA is inherently aligned with the principles of frugal innovation and Frugal AI:

*   **Resource-Efficient Agents:** The GAO’s dynamic lifecycle ensures agents are created only when needed and retired upon task completion, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead.
*   **Local Adaptation:** The taxonomy’s inclusion of local contexts and scales ensures that innovations remain grounded in **local realities** and can be implemented with available data and materials.
*   **Simplicity Through Reduction:** By structuring information and focusing on core dimensions, HA reduces cognitive complexity for users, reflecting the frugal mantra of prioritizing core functionality.

#### **Implementation and Ethical Considerations**

Implementing HA for heuristics research is a significant undertaking. Developing the GAO and a multiscale data infrastructure is technologically complex and requires specialized expertise. Ethically, this research must respect privacy, consent, and cultural norms. HA is designed with **human interpretive oversight** as a core principle, meaning AI agents operate under human control.

Effective governance structures, developed through participatory design with community members and local innovators, are essential to ensure data collection is transparent, biases are minimized, and benefits are shared equitably. A phased implementation is recommended to mitigate risks and ensure responsible deployment.

#### **Conclusion**

Frugal innovation thrives on ingenuity under constraint, with heuristics at its core. Yet, these simple rules are notoriously difficult to study and scale. **Horizons Architecture provides a rigorous and adaptive framework to meet this challenge.** Its fractal taxonomy organizes heuristics across dimensions and scales; its generative agentic ontology provides adaptive AI agents to capture and analyze them; and its temporal coordination links past, present, and future to preserve context.

Together, these features allow researchers and practitioners to systematically document heuristics, test them across contexts, and build an evidence-based repository for collective learning. By aligning with the principles of frugal innovation and Frugal AI, HA offers a **heuristic-aware, data-savvy, and ethically grounded approach** to accelerating sustainable innovation in resource-constrained environments.
