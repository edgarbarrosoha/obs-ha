CONTEXT
I was invited to give a talk about Heuristics in Frugal Innovation. I aim to demonstrate, in both an academic and practical context, how HA and its agentic AI serve as a heuristic approach, contributing to Frugal Innovation. I am giving to papers as references for the workshop. 

TASK: Make a fascinating and robust case as to how HA can help in the cómo usar HA para hacer investigación de heurística y data collection through ai agents. Lo que yo quiero argumentar, que el método es importante pero tiene que ser adaptativo y que lo que muchas veces no hacemos es cuidar las estructuras de datos, no sólo el métodos de recolección en relación al tiempo. Además, describir las ventajas de almacenar y analizar/predecir/inferir con base en evidencia para escalar esta data y que tenga la granularidad y bird-eye view necesaria para aprender colectivamente, pero poder adaptar a contextos particulares.
