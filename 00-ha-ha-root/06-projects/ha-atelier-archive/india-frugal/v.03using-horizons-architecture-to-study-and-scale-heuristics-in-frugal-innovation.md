## Workshop context and key definitions

During the **IIT Roorkee workshop on heuristics in frugal innovation** the organisers reminded participants that frugal innovation is not just about developing cheap products. According to definitions shared during the meeting, frugal innovations are _products, services and systems that are affordable and deliver good‐enough user value to people who would otherwise remain underserved_ and they often involve creating low‑cost solutions with **locally available and sustainable materials**. The focus is on core functionality, cost reduction and _reduction of complexity_. These principles match the broader literature on frugal innovation and frugal AI: frugal AI emphasises cost‑effective, sustainable innovation in resource‑scarce contexts and argues that AI systems should be designed for efficiency and accessibility[[1]](https://kdd.org/exploration_files/p72-Frugal_AI.pdf#:~:text=of%20limited%20resources,to%20cover%20all%20the%20as). The frugal acronym is sometimes parsed as **functional, robust, user‑friendly, growing, affordable and local**[[2]](https://kdd.org/exploration_files/p72-Frugal_AI.pdf#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20frugal%20innovation,raising%20barriers%20to%20recent%20innovation).

Heuristics play a central role in frugal innovation. The Handbook on Frugal Innovation notes that heuristics are **strategies that ignore some information to make decisions faster, more frugally and sometimes more accurately than complex methods**. They rely on limited cues, experience and intuition, allowing decision‑makers to adapt under information and resource scarcity. The effectiveness of a heuristic depends on how well it matches the environment (ecological rationality), and a key challenge in research is documenting the search strategies people use, the cues they rely on and the context in which a heuristic succeeds or fails. Gerd Gigerenzer’s notion of _embodied heuristics_ highlights that many heuristics exploit specific sensory and motor capacities; they are rules of thumb that enable high‑quality decisions in uncertain worlds. The _adaptive toolbox_ metaphor summarises the idea that individuals, organisations or species carry a repertoire of heuristics matched to their environments; understanding this toolbox requires mapping both the heuristics and the environmental structures that support them.

Participants at IIT Roorkee also discussed the difficulty of **capturing heuristic data**. Traditional methods – self‑reporting, interviews or simple apps – risk bias towards heuristics that were successful or memorable. Moreover, heuristics often evolve through tacit knowledge and interactions with materials, communities and technologies. The workshop therefore asked how to collect data on heuristics systematically, avoid self‑reporting biases, and develop adaptive methods that learn from practice rather than impose rigid protocols.

## Horizons Architecture overview

Horizons Architecture (HA) is a theoretical framework designed to manage complex, adaptive endeavours by **structuring information and orchestrating human‑AI collaboration across time and scale**. HA integrates three core components:

1.        **Fractal dimensional taxonomy** – a self‑similar structure organised along a **Time axis** and a **Simultaneous Complexity axis**. It maps goals, stakeholders, knowledge and resources across six dimensions (Legacy, Community, Projects, Context, Technology, Learning) and across nested levels so that information and a fixed AI-Agentic taxonomy can be organised consistently at multiple scales.

2.        **Generative Agentic Ontology (GAO)** – a dynamic intelligence layer in which AI subagents are **generated, adapted or retired** based on the system’s needs. These subagents operate within the fractal taxonomy under explicit human oversight, augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them. The GAO ensures that emergent behaviours remain aligned with ethical and strategic objectives.

3.        **Non‑Linear Temporal Coordination (NLTC)** – a coordination mechanism that explicitly links **past learning, present action and future foresight**, weaving historical data, real‑time situational awareness and scenario‑based planning into a unified temporal perspective. This mechanism allows the system to adaptively steer complex endeavours by learning from previous decisions while anticipating potential futures.

The six dimensions are not only categories for organising information but also **agents in their own right**. Each dimension constitutes a knowledge repository and acts as a high‑level agent within a fixed taxonomy. These six agents (Legacy, Community, Projects, Context, Technology, and Learning) collectively define the system’s root taxonomy and interpretive framework, and they —the agents— coordinate the instantiation of AI subagents in the GAO.

Beyond the three core components, it is essential to note that **HA is a systems-thinking method**. It can function purely as a conceptual framework for visualising and coordinating complex endeavours without any AI elements. Ideally, however, HA is implemented as a hybrid approach where human judgement and AI augmentation co‑evolve. This hybrid design reflects the flexibility of HA: it is a tool for structuring thought and collaboration that remains valuable with or without AI, yet its power grows when AI agents are used to enhance human insight.

By integrating structure (taxonomy), agency (GAO) and time (NLTC), HA bridges short‑term operational demands and long‑term transformation. Importantly, HA treats its AI agents as adaptive partners operating within a **fractal data infrastructure**. The framework’s data‑rich multiscale record not only captures outcomes but also preserves the decision pathways and human–AI interactions that led to those outcomes. This structured record facilitates learning, accountability and cross‑domain knowledge sharing.

## Why HA might be relevant to heuristics research in frugal innovation

### 1. Structuring heuristics across scales and dimensions

Heuristics emerge from tacit knowledge, local materials, cultural norms and environmental cues. Traditional research often captures heuristics as isolated anecdotes. HA’s **fractal taxonomy** offers a way to map each heuristic to the dimensions (e.g. which _Project_ it relates to, what _Context_ triggered it, how it influences the _Community_) and the level of scale (individual, team, organisation, network). Because the taxonomy is self‑similar across levels, heuristics documented at a grassroots level can be compared and aggregated at institutional or global levels without losing local specificity. This multi‑scale mapping supports two complementary views:

·      **Granular view** – researchers can examine the detailed steps, cues and interactions involved in a heuristic at a specific scale, preserving nuance.

·      **Bird’s‑eye view** – aggregated data reveal patterns across projects and communities, highlighting which heuristics generalise, which are context‑dependent, and how they evolve over time.

This approach aligns with frugal innovation’s emphasis on focusing on core functions and reducing unnecessary complexity. By organising information across dimensions, HA helps researchers avoid being overwhelmed by the vast array of cues and instead record only those that matter most to decision‑makers – an echo of the “less‑is‑more” principle of heuristics.

### 2. Dynamic AI agents for capturing and analysing heuristics

The **Generative Agentic Ontology** provides a mechanism to create AI subagents specialised in data collection, analysis and inference. These agents can be designed to:

·      **Capture decision sequences**: subagents embedded in digital tools, sensors or mobile apps can unobtrusively record the steps innovators take, the cues they attend to and the contextual factors influencing their choices. Unlike self‑reporting, this method reduces recall bias and captures _unsuccessful_ heuristics as well as successes.

·      **Classify heuristics**: agents can tag recorded decisions with taxonomic attributes (dimension, scale, time, environment) and identify whether a decision follows a known heuristic or represents a novel adaptation.

·      **Learn and adapt**: the GAO’s dynamic lifecycle means that agents evolve based on dimensional data, inter‑agent coordination and human feedback. Adaptation rules can minimise the discrepancy between desired and actual outcomes. If a heuristic consistently fails in a given context, the corresponding agent can either adjust its classification criteria or be retired, ensuring that the system remains relevant and efficient.

·      **Augment human judgement**: agents can suggest possible heuristics or highlight cues that innovators might overlook. Yet human users retain interpretive oversight, preserving ethical and contextual judgement.

Because each agent is aligned with a dimension and scale, the system can allocate computational resources frugally, focusing on high‑impact areas. Agents can also be implemented as lightweight mobile tools or chatbots, enabling **frugal AI** solutions that remain functional, robust and affordable[[2]](https://kdd.org/exploration_files/p72-Frugal_AI.pdf#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20frugal%20innovation,raising%20barriers%20to%20recent%20innovation).

### 3. Temporal coordination for ecological rationality

Heuristics are context‑dependent; what works today might not work tomorrow. HA’s **Non‑Linear Temporal Coordination** ensures that every heuristic is anchored to its temporal context. The mechanism systematically:

·      **Leverages past data**: historical records of projects, community dynamics and learning outcomes are preserved. GAO agents can mine these records for patterns, determining when and where a heuristic succeeded or failed.

·      **Grounds analysis in the present**: real‑time monitoring of projects, resource usage and environmental shifts provides the situational awareness needed to decide whether a heuristic is still applicable.

·      **Informs through foresight**: scenario‑planning and simulations help anticipate how emerging trends (e.g. climate change, regulatory shifts) might affect the validity of heuristics. Agents can simulate the performance of a heuristic under plausible futures.

This continuous feedback loop allows researchers and practitioners to evaluate heuristics based on evidence across time and to update or retire them accordingly – a practice that embodies ecological rationality. It also supports **transfer of heuristics**: a heuristic validated in one community can be tested in another under similar environmental conditions, while adjustments are guided by historical comparisons.

### 4. Building an evidence‑based repository for collective learning

One of HA’s most powerful promises is its potential to build a **collective memory** of frugal innovation practices. Traditional documentation often captures only outcomes; HA’s multiscale data infrastructure records the _decision pathways_ and **human–AI interactions** that led to those outcomes. Such a repository enables:

·      **Transparency and accountability** – researchers can trace how decisions were made and by whom, supporting more rigorous evaluation of heuristics.

·      **Cross‑domain synthesis** – the structured taxonomy facilitates interoperability between different knowledge systems (policy archives, research databases, corporate data lakes), allowing heuristics from diverse fields (e.g. health, agriculture, education) to inform one another.

·      **Scalable learning** – because the taxonomy is fractal, lessons from grassroots innovations can be scaled up to national or global levels without losing context. Conversely, high‑level insights can be localised when they are cascaded back down.

## Synergies with frugal innovation and frugal AI

The principles of frugal innovation stress affordability, simplicity, local materials and sustainability. Similarly, **frugal AI** calls for AI systems that are efficient, accessible and minimising environmental impact[[1]](https://kdd.org/exploration_files/p72-Frugal_AI.pdf#:~:text=of%20limited%20resources,to%20cover%20all%20the%20as). HA inherently supports these goals:

·      **Resource‑efficient agents** – the GAO allows specialised agents to be created only when needed and retired when their tasks are complete. This dynamic management avoids unnecessary computational overhead, aligning with frugal AI’s emphasis on doing more with less.

·      **Local adaptation** – because the taxonomy explicitly incorporates local contexts and scales, agents can utilise locally available data and materials. This ensures that innovations remain grounded in **local realities** and can be implemented in resource‑constrained environments.

·      **Simplicity through reduction** – by structuring information and focusing on core dimensions, HA reduces complexity for users. This resonates with the frugal innovation mantra of prioritising core functionalities, cost reduction and complexity reduction.

## Implementation considerations and ethical reflections

Implementing HA for heuristics research will not be trivial. The HA paper acknowledges that developing the GAO and maintaining a multiscale data infrastructure is technologically complex and requires significant investment and specialised expertise. Effective utilisation also demands training and adaptation, as the systemic, fractal and hybrid‑intelligence approach differs markedly from traditional management methods. Data quality and consistent measurement across qualitative dimensions (e.g. community trust) remain methodological challenges.

Ethically, heuristics research must respect privacy, consent and cultural norms. HA is designed with **human interpretive oversight** – AI agents operate under human control. Governance structures must ensure that data collection is transparent, biases are minimised, and benefits are shared equitably. Participatory design – involving community members, local innovators and policymakers – can help align the system with local values and build trust. Phased implementation, strong leadership commitment and clear governance protocols are recommended to mitigate socio‑political resistance and ensure responsible deployment.

## Conclusion

Frugal innovation thrives on ingenuity under constraint. Heuristics – simple rules that exploit limited information – are central to this ingenuity, yet they are notoriously difficult to study and scale. **Horizons Architecture** provides a rigorous yet adaptive framework to address this challenge. Its fractal taxonomy organises heuristics across dimensions and scales; its generative agentic ontology supplies adaptive AI agents that capture and analyse heuristics; its non‑linear temporal coordination links past learning, present action and future foresight; and its multiscale data infrastructure preserves the decision pathways behind innovations. Together, these features allow researchers and practitioners to document heuristics systematically, test them across contexts, and build an evidence‑based repository for collective learning. By aligning with the principles of frugal innovation and frugal AI, HA offers a **heursitic‑aware, data‑savvy and ethically grounded approach** to accelerating sustainable innovation in resource‑constrained environments.
