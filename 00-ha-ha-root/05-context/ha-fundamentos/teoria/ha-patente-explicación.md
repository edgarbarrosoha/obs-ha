### 1. Introduction

Complexity is an inherent part of life. Individuals and organizations often face complex endeavors that require profound thought systems, large amounts of data processing, and collective efforts to bring solutions to life. As problems become more complex, they span multiple domains and involve many stakeholders, making coordinating efforts and finding sustainable courses of action difficult. In this perspective, individuals and organizations (Governments, companies, NGOs, educational institutions, etc.) may benefit from incorporating system thinking frameworks to provide a structured approach to problem-solving, opportunity seizing, and decision-making. Enabling users to analyze a network of agents and break down complex issues into manageable parts could enhance their cognitive and actionable capacities. By utilizing these frameworks, users could more effectively identify the critical factors contributing to the project's complexity and prioritize their efforts accordingly. Additionally, system thinking frameworks can help identify potential solutions and evaluate their trade-offs while mitigating the risk of unintended consequences, such as negative externalities.

However, as powerful as systems thinking frameworks are, when it comes to complex phenomena, they may need to catch up due to the amount of data, agents, and processing involved in a complex endeavor. Therefore, incorporating AI and computational techniques might be necessary to unlock the full potential of individuals and organizations when tackling wicked efforts. The paradox is that we live in an era where data and technology surround us. Nevertheless, it is still difficult for most individuals and organizations to leverage AI and advanced computational techniques. This disconnection may be due to lack of training, database access, and data processing power to utilize these technologies effectively. AI and advanced computational techniques can arguably complement and enhance human cognitive capacities, such as critical, creative, and systems thinking, by processing, generating, and analyzing large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This human-machine symbiosis enables individuals and organizations to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions to address complex challenges efficiently and sustainably. Likewise, by providing objective and data-driven insights, computational techniques and AI can help individuals and organizations overcome cognitive biases, such as confirmation or anchoring biases. The potential value of data utilization is widely recognized across various sectors and locations. Still, most individuals and organizations require more methods, data structures, and processing power to utilize data in complex endeavors effectively.

Furthermore, many of these wicked problems require intense transdisciplinary collaboration. Therefore, transdisciplinary methods also aid individuals and organizations in their thought processes and applied techniques (human and computational) when facing complex endeavors. Transdisciplinary approaches involve bringing together people with diverse perspectives, knowledge, and skills from various disciplines to solve problems or seize opportunities collaboratively. For example, transdisciplinary research is crucial to effectively addressing climate change, which involves complex interactions between natural systems, human behavior, and socio-economic factors. There is evidence that multidisciplinary teams are more effective at problem-solving than homogeneous teams because they bring diverse perspectives and knowledge. In addition, complex endeavors also need to be conceptualized for scalability and coordination among transdisciplinary users in ever-evolving contexts and challenges. In this context, Horizons Architecture (HA) seeks to provide a systematic and integrated system thinking framework, drawing on various system theories, computational methods (AI, NLP, ML, etc.), and transdisciplinary approaches to break down complex challenges. HA proposes a taxonomy for complex general-purpose endeavors consisting of two axes (time and simultaneous complexity) and six dimensions (Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects). The HA framework consists of a system thinking framework, a HA AI & data system, and an HA collaborative fractal network that can function as stand-alone or interconnected components, all based on the same structure. The following section will describe the importance of the HA system framework, its dimensions, axes, and three stand-alone components.

# 2. Horizons Architecture (HA)

### 2.1 **What is HA:**

> Horizons Architecture (HA) is a system thinking framework that aims to enhance human-machine interactions to transform complex endeavors.
> 

It is an approach designed to address the complex challenges and opportunities when humans and machines work together to achieve a —human—collective goal. By understanding and optimizing the relationship between people and machines, HA aims to drive transformation in various domains.

### Key concepts of the definition

The following section will dissect the definition into its main components. By examining each of the Horizons Architecture (HA) components that define it, we can better understand this definition and its HA potential to improve human-machine interactions to transform the outcomes of a complex endeavor.

### 2.2 HA as a System Thinking Framework

The system thinking framework is the core structure of HA. It organizes, processes and executes information on two axes and six dimensions:

| **Axis** | **Dimensions** |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Time
 | 1. Legacy |
| 2. Simultaneous complexity. | 2. Community |
|  | 3. Learning |
|  | 4. Technology |
|  | 5. Context |
|  | 6. Projects |

This foundational structure serves as a starting point for users to organize and utilize the information when dealing with a complex endeavor, regardless of its nature. The design consists of two main axes: a non-linear timeline that includes time series and time stamps, showcasing simultaneous events occurring across multiple dimensions that influence each other during the ongoing transformation process. This timeline emphasizes the importance of studying the endeavor's past, present, and future to enable its transformation. The framework's six dimensions provide a multi-domain perspective when approaching a complex effort.

*Note: A detailed description of each axes and dimensions will appear in the following sections.* 

### 2.3 HA and Human-Machine Interaction

The HA paradigm posits that computational techniques, emerging technologies, and AI can be leveraged to enhance human-machine interactions ethically and productively. Central to the HA perspective is that intelligent machines can serve as practical mechanisms for augmenting human abilities and supporting the achievement of complex goals. HA aims to foster a more seamless and practical exchange between humans and machines, thereby enabling the transformation of complex endeavors by leveraging the strengths of both partakers (humans and machines). The precise manifestation of this enhancement may vary depending on each HA project's specific context and objectives. Still, it could include techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, visualization tools, sensory feedback mechanisms, and other technological features that optimize usability and enhance the user experience.

### 2.4 Complex endeavors

Within the framework of Horizons Architecture, a “complex endeavor” refers to the process of pursuing a desired transformation of complex phenomenon, challenge, or opportunity by an individual, organization, or a network of agents. These endeavors are characterized by high complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, regardless of their discipline, sector, or nature; they entail multiple interrelated systems, stakeholders, and processes.

### 2.5 Transformation of Complex Endeavors

In the context of Horizons Architecture, the term "transform complex endeavors" refers to using the HA approach to address complex endeavors and achieve desired outcomes. Such transformations may involve a range of functions, including, but not limited to:

- Gaining a deeper understanding of the current state of affairs (A) and the underlying systems and relationships contributing to the challenge
- Defining a clear vision and outcomes for the desired future state of affairs (B),
- Developing a systematic and transdisciplinary course of action to achieve these desired outcomes by leveraging the System Thinking Framework, the AI & Data System, and the Multi-user Fractal Network of Horizons Architecture.

Notably, these transformations often involve feedback loops, where each step informs —and is informed by— other agents, processes, or events. For example, as users gain a deeper understanding of the current state of affairs, they may uncover new information that requires them to redefine their course of action. Consequently, adaptability is a key feature of the Horizons Architecture approach, enabling users to iterate and refine their processes as they gain new insights, encounter unforeseen events, and receive further information. The objective of transforming complex endeavors lies at the heart of Horizons Architecture. By providing a starting point for committed users, this approach seeks to help tackle the most challenging problems facing individuals, organizations, and societies today, increasing their chances of creating a desirable future transformation.

### 1.5 A three stand-alone or interconnected components of HA

Having defined the principal constituents of the definition, to achieve a more nuanced comprehension of the Horizons Architecture (HA), it is helpful to conceive it as a framework composed of three interdependent or autonomous components:

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| System Thinking Framework | At its core, HA provides a structured (analog, human-based) approach to understanding complex adaptive systems and developing strategies and transdisciplinary methods to tackle them. |
| AI & Data System | The framework offers a data architecture structure supported by an AI & Data System that utilizes advanced technologies to store and process complex multi-structured data sets, making it more manageable for users to identify key insights and patterns. |
| Multi-user Fractal Network | HA provides the foundational structure to a Multi-user Fractal Network that enables collaboration and communication among stakeholders and actors involved in the complex endeavor. |

The following flowchart represents the Horizons Architecture (HA), which is made up of three independent or interconnected components: the HA System Thinking Framework, the AI & Data system, and the Users Fractal Network. The HA System Thinking Framework is positioned at the top of the flowchart and connects to both the AI & Data system and the Collaborative Fractal Network. This indicates that the HA System Thinking Framework serves as the foundational structure for both the AI & Data system and the Collaborative Fractal Network. The AI & Data system and the Collaborative Fractal Network both connect to the HA Delivery Mechanisms as "Interfaces with user." The three components conform the HA interconnected system, including humans and machines, involved in the transformation of a complex endeavor. Lastly, this flowchart show how the different components of HA can function independently (stand-alone) or as an integrated system.

In the following sections, we will look into the three main components of HA. First, we will explore the axes and dimensions of the System Thinking Framework, the foundation for the entire approach. Then, we will examine the AI & Data System, which provides the technology and computational tools necessary for human-machine interactions. Finally, we will discuss the Multi-user Fractal Network, which enables communication and collaboration among stakeholders (humans and machines), its role as *Authors of Contribution,* and the concept of *Proof of Contribution.*

# 2. The HA System Thinking Framework

The core of HA is the Thinking System Framework (TSF). The HA-TSF is the canvas for representing, visualizing, and analyzing the information to assist the analysis of the dynamics of the agents on a shared non-linear timeframe and facilitate coordination and the strategic course of action in transforming complex endeavors. Its unique framework and approach to system thinking make it a valuable asset for anyone facing complex challenges in today's rapidly changing world. It is a foundational fractal structure for individuals and organizations to analyze and break down complex endeavors into time frames, dimensions, and axes. 

In this analogical component, the emphasis is on leveraging the cognitive abilities of individuals and organizations to understand better and navigate complex adaptive systems. By internalizing the HA system thinking framework, individuals, and organizations might better understand the complexity of the endeavors at hand and develop more effective strategies to address them.

Vast academic literature supports the idea that thinking in frameworks is beneficial when facing problem-solving and decision-making. Frameworks can help individuals and organizations approach problems and decisions in a structured and comprehensive manner, leading to better outcomes (Zhao et al. (2017). Moreover, encouraging interdisciplinary and systems thinking frameworks can help individuals and organizations think more broadly and consider multiple perspectives and interconnections among different factors. This approach can lead to more innovative and effective solutions. Frameworks can provide a common language and understanding among team members, facilitating collaboration and communication. A study by Smith et al. (2018) found that using a shared decision-making framework improved communication and patient satisfaction in a healthcare setting. Frameworks can also help individuals and organizations establish clear goals and metrics for success, leading to more accountability and assessment.

By utilizing HA as a thinking framework, users might develop a more in-depth understanding of the complexity involved and arrive at more valuable strategies for addressing and managing the complexity. The HA framework encourages users to think systemically —individually and collectively— about the interconnections and interdependencies among the actors, institutions, and processes involved rather than focusing on individual components in isolation. In this way, HA can help individuals and organizations identify the most relevant issues and the underlying causes of problems and develop strategies considering the endeavor's broader context. By considering multiple perspectives and stakeholders and taking a systemic approach to decision-making, individuals and organizations can arrive at evidence-based solutions that are more effective and sustainable in addressing complex endeavors.

The HA framework comprises two fundamental axes: The X-Axis, Simultaneous Complexity, and Time X (variable time frame), the Y-Axis, and six dimensions (Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects). 

### 2.1 The Axes

**Simultaneous complexity (X-Axis):** It refers to the complexity that arises from the need to simultaneously consider and coordinate multiple dimensions, agents, internal and external events, and processes to achieve the desired transformation of the complex endeavor. It represents the intricacy of the time-based interactions between the actors, knowledge, technology, context, and projects as they work together to materialize an individual or collective Legacy. Simultaneous complexity involves coordinating the efforts and contributions of multiple individuals or groups with different skills and knowledge, considering the external socioeconomic, political, and environmental context in which the complex endeavor occurs (context). It involves managing and coordinating multiple projects or stages of the complex endeavor, including organizing and implementing the actions needed to achieve the desired outcome and aligning them with the resources, goals, and objectives established in the Legacy dimension. 

// Summarize version: This term refers to the intricate coordination required to transform complex endeavors by considering multiple dimensions, agents, and both internal and external events in real-time. It embodies the time-sensitive interactions between various actors, areas of knowledge, technologies, and contextual factors, all converging to realize an individual or collective legacy. The complexity extends to aligning the efforts of diverse groups and managing multiple project stages, all while being responsive to external socioeconomic, political, and environmental contexts. These efforts must align with established resources, goals, and objectives in the Legacy dimension.

3.1.1 Axes: Time and Simultaneous Complexity
A central premise of Horizons Architecture (HA) is that complex endeavors evolve along two orthogonal axes—Time (Time X) and Simultaneous Complexity—which, together, anchor all six HA dimensions (Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, Projects). This dual‐axis framework formalizes how multi-domain tasks unfold in both a non-linear temporal continuum and in parallel domains requiring concurrent attention [16,17].

Simultaneous Complexity signifies the need to coordinate multiple agents, processes, and external drivers at once. For instance, a public-health crisis might involve real-time data integration (Technology), stakeholder outreach (Community), regulatory adaptations (Context), emergent subprojects (Projects), and skill development (Learning)—all orchestrated around a shared purpose (Legacy). In effect, every dimension interacts dynamically with others, so that an unexpected policy shift may prompt new learning requirements or project expansions. By embedding concurrency into HA’s structural design, stakeholders can more effectively track and align cross-cutting activities rather than managing them in separate, siloed workflows [18].

Time X incorporates past, present, and future in a non-linear trajectory [19,20]. Rather than viewing transformation as a simple progression, HA posits that ongoing feedback loops—e.g., historical lessons, real-time constraints, and scenario-based forward planning—coexist. Thus, while “present” teams address urgent objectives (such as bridging supply-chain gaps or meeting legislative deadlines), they also iterate on lessons from past successes and failures [21]. Meanwhile, “future branches” supply scenario-driven insights (e.g., climate modeling, demographic shifts) that guide strategic decisions and multi-year goals [22].

By intersecting Simultaneous Complexity (the concurrency of tasks and domains) with Time X (the dynamic interplay of past–present–future), HA ensures that fractal expansions in each dimension remain synchronized with a broader legacy of knowledge and adaptive planning [23]. This structure allows local subprojects or domain-specific tasks to pivot rapidly (when real-time constraints or new data arise) without sacrificing alignment to long-range aims [24]. In practical terms, it fosters an environment where short‐term “micro‐decisions” are continuously informed by historical context and prospective foresight [25,26], ultimately enabling more robust, adaptive transformations in complex socio-technical systems.

### 2.2 Time X

Time X refers to non-linear timeline series of HA that has occurred (past), is happening (present), and might happen (future, possible scenarios) that are helpful to document the historical processes to transform complex endeavors. By establishing a non-linear timeline, it is possible to create a sense of structure and narrative that can help coordinate and manage the endeavor's complexity, learning from the past and defining what is needed for the present and future. Furthermore, time includes the interval separating the past-present and the transformational state on the continuum of the complex endeavor. In HA, it is crucial to consider the transformational potential of time to clearly understand the scope and scale of the efforts done and the requirements of future HA. In short, Time X is the canvas where several potentially interconnected agents and HAs make a mark in time to prove their contribution to the network and develop strategies and approaches for managing, navigating, and predicting future endeavors. Overall, the role of time X in HA is organizing the historical, present, and future information and the most critical variables and required actions of a complex endeavor to provide meaningful knowledge and procedural documentation for the user(s) (authors of contribution). In HA time is a critical element, as complex endeavors require ongoing attention and interventions over extended periods. The Horizons Architecture emphasizes the need for continuous learning and adaptation, with feedback loops and ongoing monitoring of progress and outcomes.

### 2.3 Relevance of Time in HA

In the Horizons Architecture (HA) context, time is a critical variable affecting complex systems' behavior and their stakeholders. HA can help identify potential scenarios and understand how different actions might impact the system's evolution by analyzing system behavior and stakeholder activities over time.
However, time is not just a practical concern for HA, but also a profound philosophical and scientific one. It is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that interacts with space, matter, energy, and consciousness in complex ways, raising fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge.
Time is a crucial variable in complex endeavors that plays a critical role in adaptation. Shorter timelines may limit opportunities for learning, feedback, and course correction, while longer timelines may increase uncertainty and make adapting to unpredictable events and changes more challenging.
Therefore, the amount of time available for a complex endeavor can significantly impact the quality and scope of its outcomes. HA emphasizes time as a critical variable, helping stakeholders consider the temporal aspects of complex endeavors and make more informed decisions about allocating resources, managing risks, and adapting to changing circumstances.

**HA NON-LINEAR TIME** 

The HA timeline is non-linear and dynamic, involving interconnected and interdependent dimensions representing different aspects of the complex endeavor being transformed. Each dimension may have its timeline and set of tasks, which may not be sequential and may overlap or occur simultaneously. Moreover, as new information is gathered and new challenges arise, the timeline may need to be adjusted or revised, resulting in a non-linear progression of the project. Additionally, the fractal structure of the HA means that each sub-project or dimension may have its timeline, which may also be interconnected and interdependent, leading to further non-linearity. Thus, the HA timeline is flexible and requires constant adjustment and revision to accommodate changing circumstances.

### Temporal perspectives

The HA framework leverages different temporal perspectives to address complex endeavors, including past-present, present, and present-future processes. 

- **The past-present** process involves analyzing past experiences, data, and knowledge to inform present decision-making and problem-solving. By looking at what has happened in the past, individuals and teams can learn from past mistakes, successes, and experiences to make better decisions and solve problems more effectively in the present.
- **The present** process focuses on identifying and addressing the most pressing issues in real time. These issues might be time-sensitive actions (e.g., deadlines, legal procedures), where individuals and organizations constantly monitor the situation and make decisions based on what is happening. The present temporal perspective prepares user(s) to respond quickly to changes and adapt to new information as it becomes available.
- **The present-future** process involves forward-thinking and strategic planning to mitigate future risks and opportunities. In other words, individuals and teams are focused on what is happening right now, thinking about what might happen and taking steps to prepare for it. By doing so, they can minimize risks and capitalize on opportunities that may arise in the future.

Fig. X Temporal non-linear perspectives in HA

The HA framework can help individuals and teams make better-informed decisions by leveraging these different temporal perspectives. By taking a comprehensive approach to transforming complex endeavors that consider the past, present, and future, individuals and teams can increase their chances of success and achieve better outcomes.

### 2.4 The four core components

Horizons Architecture (HA) is a system thinking framework that enhances human-machine interactions to transform complex endeavors. At the core of HA are four key concepts that form the foundation of its approach. These core concepts provide a starting point for individuals and teams to approach complex challenges, allowing them to develop a shared understanding of what they are trying to accomplish, who they are working with, what knowledge users have available, and how they can take action to achieve their goals. The six dimensions of HA build upon these core components, providing a framework for individuals and teams to work more systematically and inclusively to transform complex challenges.

- **Mission driven:** refers to an approach in which individuals or teams working on a complex endeavor are guided by a clear mission or purpose. This means that they have a shared understanding of what they are trying to accomplish and why it is important, and they keep this mission at the forefront of their decision-making and problem-solving processes.
- **People and context driven:** People and context: refer to the central role of individuals and organizations in any complex endeavor and the influence of the broader context on its transformation. It involves understanding the needs, perspectives, and abilities of the individuals and teams involved and the cultural, social, economic, and political context in which the endeavor takes place. HA prioritizes a people and context-centered approach by promoting collaboration, inclusivity, and diversity in complex endeavors. It also highlights the importance of considering the human factor and context when designing and implementing practical solutions. By understanding the people and context involved in a complex endeavor, HA can help individuals and teams work more effectively together and achieve their shared goals.
- **Productive knowledge, AI & data driven:** Productive knowledge and data: recognizes the critical role of relevant data and knowledge in effective decision-making and problem-solving. In the artificial intelligence and machine learning age, productive knowledge and data involve identifying and leveraging the most valuable insights from available sources to enhance human-machine interaction. HA emphasizes incorporating emerging technologies to facilitate knowledge discovery, allowing individuals and teams to develop a deeper understanding of complex endeavors. By leveraging productive knowledge and data, HA can help individuals and organizations to identify critical challenges and opportunities and develop effective strategies to achieve their goals while keeping people and context at the center of the process.
- **Action-enabling and performance-based projects:** refer to the idea that transformation in complex endeavors requires concrete action and measurable outcomes. This core concept emphasizes the importance of setting clear goals and objectives, developing actionable plans, and implementing projects that enable individuals and teams to achieve their goals effectively. The HA approach emphasizes the importance of measuring and evaluating performance to ensure the projects deliver the desired results. It also focuses on enabling action by providing individuals and teams with the necessary resources, support, and feedback to execute their plans effectively. By taking an action-enabling and performance-based approach, HA can help individuals and organizations to stay focused on their goals, make meaningful progress, and continuously improve their performance.
    
    ![HAFCycle.drawio.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/80e6b220-86c1-4bdd-839b-08bcf3583ad4/HAFCycle.drawio.png)
    

The four core components of Horizons Architecture - mission-driven, people and context, productive knowledge and data, and action-enabling and performance-based projects - provide a comprehensive framework for approaching complex endeavors. However, these core concepts were further refined and organized into six dimensions to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive framework. The six dimensions of HA provide a more detailed and nuanced approach to addressing the complexities of human-machine interactions and transformational projects. By breaking down the four core components into six dimensions - legacy, community, learning, technology, context, and projects - HA allows users to dive deeper into each dimension and identify the most critical aspects that require attention. The six dimensions of HA also enable users to understand the interdependencies and relationships between the various dimensions, providing a more holistic and integrated approach to complex endeavors. Therefore, refining the four core components into six dimensions strengthens the Horizons Architecture framework, making it more comprehensive, practical, and inclusive in driving transformational change.

![Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.31.47.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/af5dbbe4-2894-4089-a871-8142be4c6d01/Screenshot_2023-03-27_at_11.31.47.png)

The diagram illustrates how the four core components of HA are integrated into the six dimensions of the framework. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all the core components and how they relate to each of the six dimensions.

### 2.5 The dimensions

In HA, the dimensions refer to the six categories (dimensions) of information considered as a starting point in the context of a Horizons Architecture. These dimensions (Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects) serve as a taxonomy for organizing and analyzing the various types of data and information relevant to the transformation of the complex endeavor. Each dimension is associated with multiple data types or inputs. Overall, the dimensions of the HA framework aim to facilitate the organization of the information relevant to complex endeavors. This structure provides a dissected or simultaneous visual representation of the various dimensions and factors that contribute to the complexity of a particular situation or endeavor. Users may use the HA dimensions to identify critical factors and interconnections among the fundamental units that build the complex enterprise. The taxonomic nature of the AH dimensions may facilitate assessing the level of uncertainty and the potential impacts of different decisions or actions in forecasting scenarios, decision-making, and strategy development; by providing a systematic and evidence-based approach to understanding and anticipating future outcomes and trends. By visualizing the complexity of an endeavor in this time-oriented path, users may be better able to develop strategies for effectively addressing and managing the complexity involved. The six dimensions help guide the analysis, processes, and events leading to the desired transformation of the complex endeavor.

1. **Legacy:** The description of the desired outcome, objective, or goal that the user(s) of the endeavor strives to achieve in a complex endeavor. This Legacy may be economic, social, environmental, personal, or collective, or a combination of these configurations. The concept of creating value that can be transferred refers to the idea that the outcome of the complex endeavor should have a lasting impact that will continue to benefit in the future. This transfer could take the form of financial assets, knowledge, resources, systems, or institutions that will have ongoing positive impacts or knowledge or skills that can be passed down to future generations.
2. **Community:** It involves mapping the interconnected network of individuals and institutions in a semantic web. This mapping process aims to analyze the relationships between different agents in the network to understand the structure and dynamics of the network. Using network analysis techniques makes it possible to identify connections between agents and gain insights into how they relate. This analysis helps to assess social capital, which refers to the networks, norms, and trust within a group of people that facilitates cooperation and coordination.
The mapping process serves to identify agents with similar interests or complementary skills and knowledge that can contribute to a complex endeavor in various capacities and disciplines. This contribution could be individual or collective, depending on the nature of the Legacy being pursued. By understanding the network's structure and the relationships between different agents, it may be possible to leverage these connections and establish effective collaboration among stakeholders, leading to more successful outcomes for the complex endeavor.
3. **Learning:** In a HA, learning refers to identifying and prioritizing the knowledge and skills required by the user(s) (authors of contribution) to achieve the individual or collective Legacy. This process involves creating a tailored learning path with various multi-format content, tools, and resources, such as books, lectures, articles, papers, podcasts, videos, and more. The learning path is designed to identify gaps in the users’ (authors of contribution) current knowledge or capabilities and help develop a plan to address these gaps through additional learning and practice. This process aims to ensure that the authors have the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively contribute to the complex endeavor and achieve the desired Legacy outcome.
4. **Technology:** It involves identifying and prioritizing a stack of technologies and technical tools, both digital and non-digital, that can contribute to the attainment of an individual, or collective Legacy is a complex endeavor. This process includes researching and evaluating existing technologies and considering the potential for developing or adapting technologies to meet the community's specific needs. Once a list of potential computational methods, technologies and tools has been identified, the most promising options are selected based on carefully considering their costs, benefits, and feasibility. The ultimate goal is to adopt or develop the technologies and tools that will be most effective in helping the involved community achieve the desired Legacy outcome. Overall, the technology dimension plays a crucial role in supporting the complex endeavor by enabling the community to leverage the power of technology to overcome challenges and achieve their goals.
5. **Context:** It refers to collecting and processing external socioeconomic, political, and environmental data and information to understand the complex endeavor comprehensively. This process involves gathering relevant data from trustworthy sources such as government agencies, research institutions, and international organizations to increase evidence-based insights. By analyzing this data, it may be possible to identify the comparative advantages of the author(s) of contribution, including their unique skills, knowledge, or resources that give them an edge in achieving the objectives established in the legacy dimension. Finally, a deeper understanding of the context of the complex endeavor can be achieved by analyzing external data and information, which can help identify the most effective strategies for achieving the desired transformational outcomes.
6. **Projects:** This dimension describes specific, actionable activities that individuals or groups can undertake to achieve the Legacy outcome. It begins by identifying the tasks and actions needed to progress toward the desired result of the endeavor, which may require different levels of expertise and collaboration. Once these activities are defined, the resources and milestones associated with each project or subproject are determined. A plan for coordinating and managing the actions needed to achieve the outcome is developed. The project management plan serves as a guide for coordinating and managing the activities of the community involved in the network, helping to ensure that efforts are synchronized and progress is made toward achieving the desired outcome. Clearly defining and organizing the activities and projects required to achieve Legacy enables more effective coordination and management of the efforts across all six dimensions.

### 2.6 Integration of Axis and Dimensions

HA proposes a framework that integrates (simultaneously) the axis (time and complexity) and dimensions to inform and enhance the process of transformation from point A (current state) to B (desired state) when it comes to complex endeavors. By bringing together the axis and dimensions in a shared timeline, organizations and individuals may better understand the various factors that influence their objectives and create a more effective roadmap for achieving their goals. The axis provides the canvas and a framework for organizing data. At the same time, dimensions offer a multi-faceted view of the problem, enabling individuals to explore different perspectives and uncover hidden insights. By integrating these two approaches, organizations, individuals, and machines can streamline their transformation processes, reducing risk and improving their overall chances of success in transforming a complex endeavor.

![Screenshot 2023-03-21 at 09.38.13.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4acd51ba-e3bc-466f-96c8-5c78331c4662/Screenshot_2023-03-21_at_09.38.13.png)

In sum, HA is a system thinking framework designed to enhance human-machine interactions to transform complex endeavors. It aims to address the challenges and opportunities enhancing humans and machines to collaborate towards a —individual or collective— human goal by optimizing the relationship between people, machines, and their environment. This approach is built on a foundation of six dimensions: Legacy, Community, Learning, Technology, Context, and Projects, which provide an organized structure for users to understand and navigate complex endeavors more effectively.
The HA framework emphasizes the importance of mission-driven approaches, people-centric processes, productive knowledge, data use, and action-enabled, performance-based projects. By integrating these principles into the six dimensions, HA enables individuals and organizations to understand better the complexity involved in a given challenge.
